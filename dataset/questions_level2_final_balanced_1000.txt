Options:
A: Although derived metabolites from dysbiotic microbiota can elicit local inflammation, behavioral abnormalities only arise if neuronal dysfunction is established after neuroinflammation.
B: Dysregulated activation of the vagus nerve precedes intestinal barrier defects, thereby directly causing neuroinflammation without involvement of immune cell mobilization.
C: Mobilization and infiltration of immune cells into the brain occur following increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction.
D: Intestinal dysbiosis leads to barrier permeability defects, which subsequently promote local gastrointestinal inflammation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Q2: Considering the mechanistic relationships described, which outcomes would most likely be observed if Clostridia taxa with strong negative correlations to DHPS were selectively depleted in the gut microbiome of individuals with early-stage neurodegenerative diseases?
Options:
A: An increase in DHPS levels, potentially altering the balance of microbial-derived sulfur metabolites implicated in gut dysbiosis.
B: A reduction in hydrogen sulfide production, although Eubacterium and Desulfovibrio abundance remains elevated in all disease cohorts.
C: A direct increase in oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, even if DHPS catabolism is diminished.
D: A decrease in Eubacterium and Desulfovibrio abundance, thereby restoring DHPS concentrations to healthy control levels.

Options:
A: Enhanced autophagic flux leads to increased polarization of M2 microglia, which in turn reduces amyloid-β plaques and neuroinflammation.
B: Reduction in phosphorylated tau protein deposition occurs primarily through direct inhibition of microglial activation, independent of autophagy modulation.
C: The partial α-l-Fucp-(1 → substitution at the O-2 position of HCP is responsible for the observed decrease in cognitive impairment, although amyloid-β plaque levels remain unchanged.
D: HCP-induced amelioration of cognitive impairment is associated with both reduced amyloid-β plaques and decreased neuroinflammation, while autophagic flux remains unaltered.

Q4: If a patient with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibits both a delayed reduction in butyrate-producing gut bacteria and only partial improvement in Mediterranean diet adherence, which of the following outcomes may most plausibly result, given the described neuro-immune and metabolic mechanisms?
Options:
A: Persistently elevated free water in temporal and limbic gray matter regions, with limited mitigation of neuroinflammation due to insufficient restoration of butyrate-producing genera.
B: Rapid normalization of blood-brain barrier integrity, as partial dietary adherence is sufficient to fully restore SCFA-mediated neuroprotection.
C: Decreased neuroinflammation in the absence of changes in gut microbiota composition, provided that polyphenol intake is increased.
D: Initial worsening of cognitive assessment scores, unless the abundance of [Ruminococcus] gnavus group is rapidly restored by prebiotic supplementation.

Q5: If microbiota-derived SCFA are acutely elevated in germ-free AD mice while simultaneously microglial ApoE upregulation is selectively blocked, which of the following outcomes may be expected regarding Aβ plaque deposition and microglial phenotype, assuming no compensatory increase in peripheral inflammation?
Options:
A: Aβ plaque load may remain lower than in SPF mice, as SCFA-driven microglial ApoE upregulation is necessary for full promotion of Aβ deposition.
B: Microglia may show increased recruitment to plaques but fail to exhibit the transcriptomic changes associated with SCFA supplementation, potentially limiting Aβ deposition.
C: Despite blocked ApoE upregulation, SCFA elevation alone would be sufficient to restore Aβ plaque load to SPF levels, as microglial phenotype modulation is not required.
D: The absence of peripheral inflammation may override the effects of SCFA and ApoE, resulting in increased hippocampal M2 microglia and improved cognition.

Options:
A: The initial suppression of Keap-1/Nrf2 will directly increase nuclear Nrf2 content, leading to upregulation of HO-1 and NQO-1 before any changes in gut microbiota composition occur.
B: Early suppression of the Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway will reduce antioxidant enzyme activities, but subsequent butyrate elevation may attenuate neuroinflammation and oxidative damage via gut-brain axis modulation.
C: Delayed enhancement of butyrate-producing bacteria will restore blood-brain barrier integrity and modulate neuroinflammation, even if hippocampal Nrf2 signaling remains suppressed.
D: The increase in butyrate-producing bacteria will immediately reverse the effects of Keap-1/Nrf2 suppression on hippocampal iNOS and COX-2 expression, regardless of the timing of interventions.

Options:
A: Reduced hippocampal IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA upregulation may occur despite persistent amyloid deposition, as gut barrier impairment is minimized.
B: Amyloid-β accumulation is likely prevented entirely, since 5-LO suppression overrides all malathion-induced effects on the brain.
C: Neuroinflammation may still be promoted by 5-LO activity, unless the absence of dysbiosis fully blocks tryptophan metabolism disruption.
D: Hippocampal neurotransmitter imbalances may appear attenuated, as the kynurenine pathway is less activated without gut dysbiosis.

Q8: If a dietary intervention that increases bioactive polyphenol intake is introduced in a population with established Alzheimer's pathology, but the intervention only partially shifts the gut microbiota toward a healthy enterotype and fails to elevate amino acid production, which of the following outcomes are most consistent with the mechanisms described in the context?
Options:
A: Attenuation of neuroinflammation may appear limited, as the absence of increased amino acid production could restrict beneficial modulation of the microbiota-brain axis.
B: Elevation of homeostatic microglia in male subjects is expected, provided that the partial microbiota shift is sufficient to alter central immune cell phenotypes.
C: The intervention may not fully recapitulate the effects of GV-971, since GV-971’s impact on the tryptophan pathway and amino acid metabolism is not replicated.
D: Reduction in plaque-associated reactive microglia is likely to occur robustly, unless overridden by persistent peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles.

Options:
A: FMT from CRL-treated donors directly increases amyloid-β accumulation in AIMD mice by enhancing lipid hydrolysis in the gut lumen.
B: The restoration of memory function in AIMD mice is dependent on the prior normalization of peripheral unsaturated fatty acids mediated by CRL treatment in donor mice, which is then transferred via FMT.
C: The transfer of increased Acetatifactor and Clostridiales vadin BB60 genera via FMT from CRL-treated donors leads to subsequent amelioration of memory deficits in AIMD mice.
D: Immediate improvement in neuroinflammation in AIMD mice occurs before any detectable changes in gut microbial composition following FMT from CRL-treated donors.

Options:
A: BEP2 treatment increases the abundance of the S24-7 bacterial family and upregulates five metabolites, while also decreasing norepinephrine levels in the gut.
B: BEP2 administration leads to elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, although it suppresses microglial and astrocyte activity.
C: While BEP2 enhances cognitive function and reduces β-amyloid accumulation, it downregulates the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1 on microglia.
D: BEP2 increases the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and upregulates the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1 on microglia, in parallel with reduced neuroinflammation.

Q12: When considering the mechanistic basis for the neuroprotective effects of Hericium coralloides polysaccharide (HCP) in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, which of the following statements accurately reflect foundational concepts regarding its action, except when temporal or regulatory context is altered?

B: The facilitation of M2 microglial polarization by HCP is mechanistically linked to its ability to augment autophagy flux, resulting in reduced neuroinflammation.
C: Although HCP is a galactan with partial α-l-Fucp-(1 → substitution, its neuroprotective effect is independent of changes in autophagy or microglial polarization.
D: HCP ameliorates cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, while also reducing phosphorylated tau protein deposition after 8-week treatment.

Q13: Considering the foundational mechanisms described, which statements best reflect the interplay between 5-lipoxygenase pathway activity and microbial dysbiosis in the context of Alzheimer’s disease progression?
Options:
A: Although 5-LO activity accelerates tau phosphorylation and amyloid deposition, its direct regulatory effect on gut dysbiosis has not been established.
B: While gut dysbiosis is correlated with AD development, it is currently unclear whether 5-LO activation in the brain is a downstream consequence of dysbiosis-induced neuro-inflammation.
C: Pro-inflammatory mediators produced by gut dysbiosis, such as LPS and bacterial amyloids, directly increase 5-LO expression in the brain, thereby initiating amyloid plaque formation.
D: The use of 5-LO pathway knockout mice under gnotobiotic conditions may help clarify whether microbial dysbiosis is a cause or effect of 5-LO-mediated neuro-inflammation.

Q14: If a therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice simultaneously increases the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria but only partially restores intestinal barrier integrity, while a separate intervention fully normalizes intestinal peptide hormone release without altering gut microbiota composition, which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the described mechanisms?
Options:
A: Cognitive improvement may be observed primarily when both SCFA-producing bacteria abundance and intestinal peptide hormone release are normalized, as partial restoration of the intestinal barrier alone is insufficient to reduce amyloid deposition.
B: Enhancement of learning ability and memory may occur with increased SCFA-producing bacteria even if intestinal peptide hormone release remains unaltered, unless the intervention fails to restore the balance of Firmicutes and butyric acid.
C: Full normalization of intestinal peptide hormone release without changes in gut microbiota composition may initially lead to improved cognitive function, unless overridden by persistent dysbiosis and unchanged SCFA levels.
D: Reduction in amyloid deposition in brain tissue is likely only if both the intestinal barrier and gut microbial metabolite concentrations are simultaneously restored, as isolated normalization of peptide hormones does not affect β-amyloid pathology.

Options:
A: ATEP enhances antioxidant enzyme activities, which subsequently suppresses the Keap-1/Nrf2 signaling pathway, leading to altered expression of HO-1 and NQO-1.
B: Remodeling of gut microbiota by ATEP is associated with regulation of short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria, although this effect is not directly mediated by changes in hippocampal CA3 neuronal morphology.
C: Suppression of the Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway by ATEP results in changes in nuclear Nrf2 content, thereby modulating downstream oxidation-related enzymes such as iNOS and COX-2.
D: Altered Nrf2 content in the nucleus, as influenced by ATEP, leads to changes in the expression of oxidation-related enzymes, which in turn affects neuronal morphology in the hippocampal CA3 region.

B: Restoration of gut microbiota homeostasis by PCA is mechanistically unrelated to the regulation of serum metabolites or cognitive function in the Aβ<sub>25-35</sub> model.
C: PCA reduces the abundance of pro-inflammatory-associated gut microbiota, which is closely linked to changes in serum metabolites involved in glucose, arachidonic acid, tyrosine, and phospholipid metabolism.
D: PCA ameliorates Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced disruption of glucose metabolism primarily through activation of PI3K/AKT/Glut1 signaling, while also modulating neuroinflammation via inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation.

Options:
A: Early malathion-induced reduction of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia would precede gut barrier impairment, leading to increased neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites and subsequent upregulation of hippocampal IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA.
B: Delayed ATEP intervention would immediately restore hippocampal 5-HT levels, thereby preventing malathion-induced cognitive impairment regardless of prior gut dysbiosis.
C: The initial disruption of tryptophan metabolism by malathion would promote neuroinflammation before ATEP-mediated enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activities could suppress the Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway and alter hippocampal neuronal morphology.
D: Malathion-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis would directly increase hippocampal NQO-1 and HO-1 expression prior to any changes in oxidative stress or neuroinflammation.

Q18: When considering the mechanistic relationship between quinolinic acid (QA), butyrate, and cognitive impairment in obesity models, which of the following statements accurately reflect foundational concepts regarding their regulatory interactions and outcomes, particularly under conditions of altered QA or butyrate exposure?
Options:
A: Butyrate prevents QA-induced reductions in BDNF by directly inhibiting QA synthesis, rather than through epigenetic mechanisms at BDNF promoters.
B: Butyrate reverses QA-induced cognitive impairment by epigenetically increasing H3K18ac at BDNF promoters, thereby restoring BDNF levels in both in vivo and in vitro models.
C: QA exposure in diet-induced obese mice leads to increased cortical BDNF levels, which is subsequently normalized by butyrate through modulation of gut microbiota composition.
D: While QA impairs neurons and reduces dendritic spine signaling, butyrate counteracts these effects, except when BDNF levels remain unchanged.

Q19: If a therapeutic protocol in 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease mice involves partial suppression of butyrate-producing microbes while simultaneously administering MOS, and SCFAs supplementation is delayed until after HPA-axis hormone levels have normalized, which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the described mechanisms?
Options:
A: Early normalization of HPA-axis hormones will override the need for butyrate-producing microbes, resulting in full prevention of Aβ accumulation regardless of SCFAs timing.
B: Gut barrier integrity damage is likely to persist, since MOS cannot prevent LPS leak in the absence of immediate SCFAs supplementation.
C: The reduction in Aβ accumulation may appear incomplete, unless the delayed SCFAs supplementation compensates for the initial deficit in butyrate formation.
D: Cognitive and behavioral improvements may be attenuated, as MOS-induced gut microbiota reshaping is only partially effective without immediate SCFAs enhancement.

Q20: In a scenario where malathion exposure first induces gut microbiota dysbiosis and tryptophan metabolism disruption, followed by delayed administration of P-coumaric acid (PCA), which of the following outcomes would most likely occur at both the metabolic and neuroinflammatory regulatory levels, considering the described mechanistic pathways and temporal sequence?
Options:
A: Malathion-induced reduction in Lactobacillus and Akkermansia would enhance serotonin (5-HT) pathway activity, thereby counteracting neuroinflammation regardless of PCA timing.
B: Delayed PCA intervention could still inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-κB and modulate MAPK signaling, reducing neuroinflammation despite prior increases in hippocampal IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA.
C: PCA would reduce the abundance of pro-inflammatory-associated microbiota and restore glucose metabolism via PI3K/AKT/Glut1 activation, thereby ameliorating neuroinflammation even after malathion-induced dysbiosis.
D: Immediate PCA administration would directly prevent malathion-induced activation of the colonic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and subsequent kynurenine pathway upregulation, fully blocking neurotoxic metabolite accumulation.

Options:
A: The upregulation of ApoE in microglia following SCFA supplementation will precede the reduction in intracellular Aβ content within microglia, despite increased recruitment to plaques.
B: The combined MOS and SCFA supplementation will restore Aβ plaque load in germ-free mice to levels observed in conventionally colonized animals, likely via SCFA-driven modulation of microglial transcriptomic profiles.
C: The beneficial effects of MOS on cognitive function and redox status will be negated by SCFA supplementation, as SCFAs exclusively exacerbate Aβ deposition and have no role in behavioral modulation.
D: Behavioral improvements and attenuation of anxiety-like behaviors will be observed only if the gut barrier integrity is compromised prior to MOS administration, due to increased LPS leakage.

Q22: In a scenario where aged APP/PS1 mice are first rendered germ-free to eliminate microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and then, after a delay, receive exogenous Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) treatment, which of the following predictions about hippocampal and systemic outcomes most accurately reflects the temporally sequenced, hierarchical regulatory effects described in the context?
Options:
A: The delayed CRL administration will directly increase SCFA plasma concentrations in germ-free APP/PS1 mice, thereby restoring Aβ plaque deposition to levels observed in conventionally colonized animals.
B: Despite the absence of initial microbiota-derived SCFAs, CRL treatment will alter gut lipid hydrolysis and peripheral unsaturated fatty acid profiles, but will not independently induce the microglial transcriptomic changes associated with SCFA supplementation.
C: The sequential absence of microbiota and subsequent CRL treatment will result in persistent reduction of neuroinflammation and memory deficits, as CRL’s effects are independent of gut microbial composition.
D: Hippocampal metabolic and gene expression profiles in these mice will reflect both the lack of microbiota-derived metabolites and the downstream impact of altered gut lipid metabolism, leading to a distinct pattern of dysregulated inflammation and synaptic signaling.

Q23: In a scenario where malathion exposure first induces gut microbiota dysbiosis (notably reducing Lactobacillus and Akkermansia) and this is followed by administration of Agaricus sinodeliciosus var. Chaidam exopolysaccharide (EPS) after the onset of hippocampal neurotransmitter imbalance, which of the following predictions about the regulatory cascade from gut microbiota to neuroinflammation and cognitive function is most consistent with the described mechanisms?
Options:
A: EPS administration, by increasing Ruminococcaceae and reducing Erysipelotrichaceae, prevents the malathion-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier, thereby blocking all downstream neuroinflammatory signaling regardless of prior neurotransmitter imbalance.
B: Malathion-induced activation of the kynurenine pathway precedes the upregulation of hippocampal IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA, which is then reversed by EPS-mediated enhancement of microglial Aβ phagocytosis via the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway.
C: The initial reduction in Lactobacillus and Akkermansia directly increases hippocampal 5-HT levels, which then triggers microglial activation and accelerates Aβ accumulation.
D: EPS administration is likely to reconstruct gut microbiota composition, increase serotonin production, and subsequently suppress neuroinflammatory responses, thereby alleviating cognitive deficits even after malathion-induced tryptophan metabolism disruption.

Q24: Considering the mechanistic interplay between gut microbiota and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression, which of the following statements accurately reflect foundational concepts regarding signaling pathways or therapeutic interventions, except when the regulatory context is temporally reversed?
Options:
A: The cGAS-STING and TLR4 Myd88 pathways are implicated in gut dysbiosis-mediated neuroinflammation that promotes AD, although their activation is not directly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.
B: While short-chain fatty acids produced by gut bacteria maintain blood-brain barrier integrity, their depletion during gut dysbiosis contributes to neuroinflammation in AD.
C: Probiotic therapy, by restoring gut microbial diversity, alleviates both pathological and psychological consequences associated with AD progression.
D: Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by altered gut microbiota precedes glial cell activation and directly initiates the release of proinflammatory cytokines in AD.

Q25: When considering the foundational concept of gut microbiome modulation in APP/PS1 mice, which of the following outcomes would most likely occur following exogenous Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) administration, except when the intervention is applied after fecal matter transplant (FMT) into antibiotic-induced microbiome-depleted (AIMD) wildtype mice?
Options:
A: Increased abundance of Acetatifactor and Clostridiales vadin BB60 genera in the gut is observed, while neuroinflammation and memory deficits are reduced.
B: Normalization of peripheral unsaturated fatty acids occurs concurrently with increased lipid hydrolysis in the gut lumen, except when CRL is administered after FMT in AIMD mice.
C: Memory improvements in APP/PS1 mice are not transferable to AIMD wildtype mice via FMT, although gut microbiome composition is altered.
D: The amelioration of AD-like pathology in APP/PS1 mice is associated with targeted modification of the gut, whereas peripheral unsaturated fatty acids remain unchanged.

Q26: When considering foundational concepts from the multi-omics analysis of the aged mouse hippocampus, which of the following statements most accurately reflect mechanistic relationships between metabolic, gene expression, and behavioral changes, except when the directionality or context is misapplied?
Options:
A: Although altered microbiota-derived metabolites (MDMs) are observed in aged hippocampal tissue, their role in mediating gut-brain interactions during aging is only inferred and not directly evidenced by the multi-omics data.
B: Dysregulation of pathways related to inflammation, microglial activation, and synaptic signaling in the aged hippocampus is mechanistically linked to observed reductions in exploration, locomotion, learning, and memory activities.
C: The identification of 69 differentially abundant metabolites and 376 differentially expressed genes in the aged hippocampus directly demonstrates that behavioral changes cause metabolic and gene expression alterations.
D: While metabolic perturbations and gene expression changes are associated with behavioral deficits in aged mice, the co-expression network analysis specifically implicates both cell death and cellular/tissue homeostasis pathways as dysregulated during hippocampal aging.

Q27: If a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease is engineered such that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activity is only partially suppressed while the gut microbiome is simultaneously shifted to favor increased TMAO production, which of the following outcomes may most plausibly result, given the described interrelationships and absence of compensatory mechanisms?
Options:
A: Despite partial 5-LO suppression, increased TMAO may still promote neuroinflammation and tau hyperphosphorylation, as TMAO can independently regulate NLRP3/ASC/caspase1 and PERK/eIF2α/ER-stress pathways.
B: The partial reduction of 5-LO activity would fully prevent amyloid deposition, even if TMAO-induced neuroinflammation persists.
C: Restoration of intestinal flora balance would be expected to alleviate neurodegeneration, but only if 5-LO is completely absent and TMAO levels are simultaneously reduced.
D: The shift in microbiome composition toward TMAO producers may initially lead to blood-brain barrier damage and immune responses, unless overridden by complete 5-LO knockout.

Q28: If a patient with Alzheimer's disease experiences both a partial reduction in gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and an incomplete restoration of microglial maturation via probiotic supplementation, which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the described mechanisms, assuming no compensatory increase in physical activity or synbiotic use?
Options:
A: The patient may exhibit persistent neuroinflammation and exacerbated tau pathology, as SCFA deficiency and only partial microglial maturation fail to fully suppress inflammatory responses in the CNS.
B: The patient is likely to show immediate normalization of cognitive function, since probiotic supplementation alone is sufficient to reverse all pathological features of AD regardless of SCFA levels.
C: There may be a continued disruption of neuronal function, unless overridden by increased levels of tryptophan metabolites, which are not directly addressed by the described interventions.
D: The resilience of a healthy microbiota may appear to protect against dysbiosis-related pathologies, but without adequate SCFA production and full microglial maturation, this protection remains incomplete.

Q29: In a scenario where APP/PS1 transgenic (AD) mice are first subjected to a 16-week course of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) treatment that increases the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and only after this period are exposed to a marine-derived oligosaccharide (GV-971) intervention at a stage when Aβ burden is already near maximal, which of the following predictions about the hierarchical effects on mitochondrial function, neuroinflammation, and microglial phenotypes is most consistent with the described regulatory order and timing?
Options:
A: The delayed introduction of GV-971 after NMN would result in a reduction of peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but only if microglial activation had already been suppressed by NMN-induced epigenetic changes.
B: GV-971 administration prior to NMN would directly increase the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bacteroides, thereby improving mitochondrial function and reducing neuroinflammation in a sex-independent manner.
C: The sequential treatment would first reduce neuroinflammation via NMN, but subsequent GV-971 exposure would reverse these benefits by increasing plaque-associated reactive microglia, especially in female mice.
D: The initial NMN-induced increase in SCFA-producing bacteria would improve mitochondrial function and intestinal health, which could subsequently enhance the efficacy of GV-971 in reducing plaque-associated reactive microglia and neuroinflammatory signatures, particularly in male mice.

Q30: If a patient with Crohn's disease develops a dysbiosis that selectively increases TMAO-producing bacteria but only partially disrupts the intestinal barrier, which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the mechanisms described, assuming no compensatory reduction in neuroinflammatory signaling?
Options:
A: Partial disruption of the intestinal barrier would initially lead to reduced neuroinflammation, unless overridden by increased TMAO crossing into the central nervous system.
B: Systemic inflammation from Crohn's disease may appear to increase the risk of neurodegenerative disease, but without elevated TMAO, the modulation of NLRP3/ASC/caspase1 signaling would be negligible.
C: The presence of bacterial amyloids from gut microbiota would directly prevent tau hyperphosphorylation in the central nervous system, unless TMAO levels are simultaneously suppressed.
D: The patient may exhibit increased risk of Alzheimer's disease due to TMAO-induced neuroinflammation and enhanced Aβ expression, even if the intestinal barrier is not fully compromised.

Q31: If an Alzheimer's disease mouse model is subjected to both a high-fat diet (HFD) that increases peripheral inflammation but moderates neuroinflammation, and is simultaneously given Armillariella tabescens-derived polysaccharides (ATEP) that suppress the Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway and remodel gut microbiota, which of the following outcomes are most consistent with the foundational mechanisms described in the context, assuming no compensatory upregulation of LXR/PPAR expression occurs?
Options:
A: There may be a reduction in hippocampal neuroinflammation due to ATEP's anti-inflammatory effects, even if peripheral inflammation is elevated by HFD.
B: The absence of LXR/PPAR upregulation would likely prevent HFD from moderating neuroinflammation, unless ATEP's remodeling of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria compensates.
C: Cognitive impairment may persist if neither HFD nor ATEP alters the gut microbiota composition, despite changes in oxidative stress markers.
D: Increased cholesterol levels from HFD would directly enhance the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, thereby amplifying ATEP's neuroprotective effects.

Q32: In a scenario where an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model is first subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) resulting in peripheral inflammation and altered gut microbiota, and subsequently receives Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) intervention, which of the following predictions about the regulatory cascade from gut microbiota to neuroinflammation and cognitive function is most consistent with the described mechanisms and temporal sequence in the context?
Options:
A: The sequence of HFD followed by HLJDD will first cause a remission of neuroinflammation, which is then reversed by HLJDD-induced exacerbation of gut microbiota imbalance, ultimately worsening cognitive outcomes.
B: HLJDD is expected to globally suppress both neuroinflammation and lipid accumulation, thereby relieving cognitive impairment that may have persisted after HFD-induced peripheral inflammation and microbiota alteration.
C: The initial HFD-induced increase in peripheral cholesterol directly improves contextual memory in AD mice, which is then further enhanced by HLJDD through upregulation of Aβ levels.
D: HLJDD intervention, following HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, is likely to restore microbiota balance and reduce neuroinflammation, but would have no effect on cognitive impairment due to irreversible CNS damage.

Q33: In a scenario where gut microbial dysbiosis is first induced in aged mice, followed by administration of exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Agaricus sinodeliciosus var. Chaidam, which of the following predictions about the hierarchical sequence from gut microbiota alteration to neuroinflammatory and cognitive outcomes is most consistent with the described regulatory mechanisms and feedbacks in the context?
Options:
A: EPS administration is expected to reconstruct the gut microbiota by increasing Ruminococcaceae and reducing Erysipelotrichaceae, which subsequently enhances serotonin production and microglial Aβ-phagocytosis via the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway, leading to improved cognitive function and suppressed neuroinflammation.
B: The initial dysbiosis-induced increase in pro-inflammatory mediators such as LPS and bacterial amyloids will directly suppress microglial Aβ-phagocytosis, and EPS administration will further exacerbate neuroinflammation by increasing Erysipelotrichaceae abundance.
C: Restoration of cognitive function and redox balance by EPS occurs independently of any changes in gut microbiota composition or serotonin production, relying solely on direct suppression of tau phosphorylation.
D: EPS-induced modulation of the gut microbiome precedes the reduction of Aβ1-42 accumulation in the hippocampus, with behavioral and neuroinflammatory improvements occurring only after microglial activation is established through the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway.

Q34: In a scenario where an APP/PS1 mouse model is first subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) that alters gut microbiota composition and increases peripheral inflammation, and is subsequently treated with Kai Xin San-Jia Wei (KXSJW) extract for two months, which of the following outcomes would most likely occur across both gut and brain regulatory levels, considering the temporally sequenced interventions and the hierarchical relationship between gut metabolites, intestinal barrier function, and cognitive performance?
Options:
A: The improvement in cognitive function observed after KXSJW administration is primarily due to the direct suppression of neuroinflammation by HFD, with no involvement of gut microbiota or their metabolites.
B: The initial HFD-induced increase in peripheral cholesterol directly reduces β-amyloid deposition in the brain, independent of subsequent KXSJW intervention.
C: KXSJW administration after HFD would restore the balance of intestinal flora, particularly increasing butyric acid production, which in turn improves intestinal barrier integrity and ameliorates cognitive impairment in the AD mouse model.
D: KXSJW treatment following HFD would enhance the release of intestinal peptide hormones such as Glucagon and GHRP-Ghrelin, contributing to improved gut environment and cognitive function.

Q35: If a patient with early-stage Alzheimer's disease exhibits both a partial suppression of TMAO production and a simultaneous increase in gut bacteria involved in DHPS metabolism, which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the mechanistic interplay described in the context?
Options:
A: Reduced TMAO may initially limit amyloid and tau aggregation, but increased Eubacterium and Desulfovibrio could promote inflammation and oxidative stress via excess hydrogen sulfide, sustaining neurodegenerative processes.
B: Although TMAO suppression may decrease NF-kB activation, the upregulation of Clostridia taxa negatively correlated with DHPS could paradoxically enhance mitochondrial damage through cryptic sulfur metabolism.
C: The combination of lower TMAO and higher DHPS-metabolizing bacteria would be expected to fully restore blood-brain barrier integrity and halt neuronal death, unless overridden by persistent epigenetic dysregulation.
D: Increased DHPS metabolism by gut bacteria may appear to compensate for TMAO reduction by preventing neuroinflammation, unless the dynamic interplay with miRNA signatures is disrupted by dietary factors.

Q36: When considering the foundational concept of SDG’s action in female Alzheimer’s disease mice, which of the following statements best distinguishes the mechanistic basis for its neuroprotective effects under conditions of altered gut microbiota metabolism or GPER/CREB/BDNF pathway modulation?
Options:
A: SDG’s neuroprotective effects are primarily mediated by direct estrogen replacement, although this is independent of gut microbiota metabolism.

Options:
A: Disruption of the intestinal barrier by gut microbiota and their metabolites primarily impairs BBB integrity through direct neural invasion, while systemic chronic inflammation is a secondary effect.
B: BBB permeability is increased as a result of gut mucosal immunity dysregulation leading to excessive gut inflammation, which is often modulated by dietary components and age.
C: The blood-brain barrier acts as a biomarker associated with neural pathogenesis because its permeability is directly regulated by the anatomical properties of the gut microbiota.

Options:
A: Systemic inflammation may be reduced due to NF-κB inhibition, but incomplete NRF2 activation could limit the enhancement of cellular antioxidant defenses, potentially leaving oxidative stress unresolved.
B: Full inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by curcumin would directly restore gut microbiota diversity, even if gut-derived metabolites remain unchanged.
C: Partial NRF2 activation in the context of age-related dysbiosis may initially lead to increased β-amyloid formation, unless overridden by oral bacteria modulation.

Options:
A: Neuroinflammation and memory impairment may only be partially alleviated, unless the RAGE-JAK2-STAT3 pathway inhibition by IPA is completely unopposed.
B: IPA’s ability to maintain BBB and intestinal barrier integrity may be compromised, as partial JAK2-STAT3 activation can counteract its neuroprotective effects.
C: IPA-induced reduction of LPS-triggered apoptosis in HT22 cells will be enhanced by JAK2-STAT3 activation, unless overridden by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines from the gut.
D: The remodeling of gut microbiota by IPA will be fully preserved, since JAK2-STAT3 signaling does not influence microbiota composition in the context of neuroinflammation.

Options:
A: The initial increase in dietary fiber will immediately restore butyrate-producing microbial populations, leading to rapid improvement in blood-brain barrier integrity and reduction of neuroinflammation before prebiotic intervention.
B: The delayed introduction of prebiotics will postpone the enhancement of short-chain fatty acid production, thereby slowing the modulation of neuroinflammation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, despite early dietary changes.
C: Early dietary change alone, without concurrent prebiotic support, will directly suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine mobilization into the brain, preventing neurodegeneration regardless of the state of the gut microbiota.
D: The sequence of dietary intervention followed by prebiotic administration will result in a temporally staggered improvement in gut microbial balance, with subsequent downstream effects on epigenetic regulation and amyloid protein formation in Alzheimer's disease.

Options:
A: Butyrate would first reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 by activating microglial Aβ-phagocytosis through the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway, which then increases serotonin production and directly clears Aβ in the hippocampus.
B: The initial HFD-induced gut dysbiosis would directly increase the abundance of Ruminococcaceae, leading to immediate restoration of synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice.
C: Butyrate administration after HFD-induced obesity would epigenetically enhance H3K18ac at BDNF promoters, counteracting quinolinic acid-induced BDNF reduction and neuronal spine loss, thereby ameliorating cognitive impairment.

Options:
A: PCA’s delayed administration would directly restore autophagic flux in microglia, leading to immediate reduction in phosphorylated tau, independent of gut microbiota changes.
B: HCP’s neuroprotective effects would be negated if pro-inflammatory-associated gut microbiota remain unaltered due to the absence of early PCA intervention.
C: The sequential use of PCA and HCP would synergistically inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-κB, but only if glucose metabolism is first normalized by PCA via PI3K/AKT/Glut1 activation.

Options:
A: The reduction in pathogenic bacteria such as Allobaculum from exercise would persist, but the loss of SCFA-producing bacteria would negate the anti-inflammatory benefits, potentially increasing LPS displacement and neuroinflammation.
B: Amyloid-β pathology in the brain would be directly reduced by the absence of SCFA-producing bacteria, as their metabolites are implicated in amyloid aggregation according to the context.
C: The depletion of SCFA-producing bacteria after exercise would have no effect on neuroinflammation, since exercise alone is sufficient to maintain gut-brain axis homeostasis regardless of microbial metabolite changes.
D: The initial exercise-induced enrichment of gut microbial diversity and increased intestine-brain barrier proteins would be undermined by subsequent SCFA-producer depletion, likely resulting in a rebound of neuroinflammation due to loss of anti-inflammatory SCFA effects.

Options:
A: Free water values in limbic and paralimbic regions may initially remain high, unless overridden by a compensatory increase in short-chain fatty acid production from non-butyrate-producing bacteria.
B: Neuroinflammation in gray matter regions may persist due to insufficient butyrate, despite partial attenuation of neurodegenerative processes via dietary modulation of the gut microbiota-brain axis.
C: Cognitive impairment is likely to be fully reversed, as dietary polyphenols directly restore butyrate-producing genera to baseline levels observed in cognitively normal controls.
D: The risk of amyloid-beta accumulation may remain elevated unless the diet specifically increases Lactobacillus reuteri abundance or provides exogenous ILA to activate AhR signaling.

Options:
A: Cognitive function may remain unimproved, as BEP2’s suppression of neuroinflammation is insufficient to compensate for the lack of exercise-induced synaptic plasticity enhancement in middle-aged mice.
B: The abundance of S24-7 family bacteria may still increase, since BEP2’s modulation of gut microbiota is not contingent on exercise-induced changes in circulating metabolites.
C: A marked reduction in tau phosphorylation is likely, unless the partial suppression of ADAM10 by exercise overrides BEP2’s effects on microglial activity.
D: Elevation of Allobaculum abundance may be prevented, as BEP2’s inability to upregulate norepinephrine directly impairs exercise-driven gut microbiota shifts.

Options:
A: Cognitive impairment may persist due to incomplete reversal of QA-induced BDNF reduction, unless butyrate-mediated H3K18ac enhancement at BDNF promoters is fully restored.
B: Neuroinflammation may initially be alleviated by partial SCFA restoration, but the absence of probiotic-induced microbial diversity normalization could allow continued activation of glial cells and proinflammatory cytokine release.
C: Blood-brain barrier integrity may be maintained solely by partial SCFA restoration, even if gut dysbiosis-driven oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction remain unaddressed.
D: The modulation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways may appear improved, unless overridden by persistent QA-induced neuronal spine loss and reduced BDNF.

Options:
A: The initial reduction in amyloid-β pathology due to germ-free conditions would be reversed by Synbiotics, as restoration of gut microbiota-derived metabolites can reactivate neuroinflammatory pathways and increase Aβ deposition.
B: Synbiotics administration would further suppress neuroinflammation beyond the effect of germ-free conditions, as PPARs activation directly inhibits microglial priming regardless of gut microbiota presence.
C: Cognitive function would deteriorate compared to untreated APP/PS1 mice, since the sequential restoration of gut microbiota and PPARs activation synergistically promote tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration.
D: The introduction of Synbiotics after germ-free conditions would result in a complex interplay, where gut microbiota-derived factors may partially restore Aβ pathology, but PPARs pathway activation by Synbiotics would counteract neuroinflammation, leading to an intermediate cognitive outcome.

Options:
A: The delayed KXSJW intervention will immediately restore cognitive function by directly increasing BDNF levels in the brain, independent of changes in gut microbiota or SCFA concentrations.
B: The absence of butyrate-producing Firmicutes will impair KXSJW’s ability to regulate intestinal flora metabolites, thereby limiting its downstream effects on intestinal barrier integrity and cognitive improvement.
C: Early amyloid deposition prior to KXSJW administration will enhance the efficacy of KXSJW in restoring gut microbiota balance, as the pathological state increases responsiveness to intervention.
D: KXSJW’s effect on cognitive function in this context will be attenuated due to the lack of butyrate-mediated modulation of both gut barrier function and neuroinflammation, as supported by the multi-level role of SCFAs in AD pathogenesis.

Options:
A: Cognitive function may initially improve due to preserved SCFA-mediated gut-brain signaling, despite persistent neuroinflammation linked to incomplete F/B ratio normalization.
B: Amyloid-β accumulation in the hippocampus is rapidly cleared, as partial F/B ratio restoration is sufficient to activate the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway in microglia.
C: Systemic inflammation is fully resolved, since SCFA levels alone determine the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNFα.
