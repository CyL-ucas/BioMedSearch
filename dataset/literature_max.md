## 1. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) alone or in combination regulate select immune functions of microglia-like cells.

Neuroinflammation contributes to neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Gut microbes are involved in regulating systemic inflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are among the many metabolites released by gut microbes, can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and interact with microglia. High concentrations of individual SCFAs decrease the inflammatory responses of peripheral monocytes; therefore, we hypothesized that SCFAs act on their own or in combinations to reduce the inflammatory response of microglia. Cultured human THP-1 monocytic cells and differentiated human HL-60 myelomonocytic cells were used to model select immune functions of human microglia. Acetate, propionate, butyrate, formate, and valerate were added to cells alone or as a mixture containing SCFAs at an approximate physiological concentration ratio. The SCFA mixture, as well as several individual SCFAs at the highest concentrations used in the mixture (15-236 μM), decreased the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and cytotoxins by immune-stimulated THP-1 cells. GLPG 0974, a free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2/3 antagonist, did not block the inhibitory effect of the SCFA mixture on IL-1β secretion by THP-1 cells while blocking the inhibitory effect of formate alone. We demonstrated that formate and valerate alone reduced the phagocytic activity of immune-stimulated THP-1 cells. Formate, but not valerate, alone also inhibited the N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced respiratory burst of HL-60 cells, reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our data indicate that SCFAs could regulate select microglial functions that are disrupted in AD.

## 2. Elucidating the specific mechanisms of the gut-brain axis: the short-chain fatty acids-microglia pathway.

In recent years, the gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized for its influence on various central nervous system diseases mediated by microglia, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. As key metabolites of the gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have emerged as a focal point in understanding microglia-related interactions. In this review, we further refine the connection between the gut microbiota and microglia by introducing the concept of the "SCFAs-microglia" pathway. We summarize current knowledge on this pathway, recent discoveries regarding its role in neurological diseases, and potential pharmacological strategies targeting it. Finally, we outlined the current challenges and limitations in this field of research. We hope this review provides new insights into the role of the gut microbiota in neuroimmune regulation.

## 3. Links between short-chain fatty acids and osteoarthritis from pathology to clinic via gut-joint axis.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the primary metabolites produced by the microbial fermentation of dietary fibers in the gut, have a key role in protecting gut health. Increasing evidence indicates SCFAs can exert effects on distant tissues and organs beyond the gut via blood circulation. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease that severely diminishes the physical function and quality of life. However, effective clinical treatments for OA remain elusive. Recent studies have shown that SCFAs can exert beneficial effects on damaged joints in OA. SCFAs can mitigate OA progression by preserving intestinal barrier function and maintaining the integrity of cartilage and subchondral bone, suggesting that they have substantial potential to be the adjunctive treatment strategy for OA. This review described the SCFAs in the human body and their cellular signaling mechanism, and summarized the multiple effects of SCFAs (especially butyrate, propionate, and acetate) on the prevention and treatment of OA by regulating the gut-joint axis, providing novel insights into their promising clinical applications.

## 4. The impact of gut microbial short-chain fatty acids on colorectal cancer development and prevention.

Cancer is a long-term illness that involves an imbalance in cellular and immune functions. It can be caused by a range of factors, including exposure to environmental carcinogens, poor diet, infections, and genetic alterations. Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is crucial for overall health, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiota play a vital role in this process. Recent research has established that alterations in the gut microbiome led to decreased production of SCFA's in lumen of the colon, which associated with changes in the intestinal epithelial barrier function, and immunity, are closely linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) development and its progression. SCFAs influence cancer progression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA functions thereby affecting tumor initiation and metastasis. This suggests that restoring SCFA levels in colon through microbiota modulation could serve as an innovative strategy for CRC prevention and treatment. This review highlights the critical relationship between gut microbiota and CRC, emphasizing the potential of targeting SCFAs to enhance gut health and reduce CRC risk.

## 5. Akkermansia mono-colonization modulates microglia and astrocytes in a strain specific manner.

Microglia and astrocytes are the primary glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and their function is shaped by multiple factors. Regulation of CNS glia by the microbiota have been reported, although the role of specific bacteria has not been identified. We colonized germ-free mice with the type strain Akkermansia muciniphila (Am(T)) and a novel A. muciniphila strain BWH-H3 (Am-H3) isolated from a subject with multiple sclerosis and compared to mice colonized with Bacteroides cellulosilyticus strain BWH-E5 (Bc) isolated from a healthy control subject. We then investigated the effect of these bacteria on microglia and astrocyte gene expression by RNA sequencing. We found altered gene expression profiles in brain microglia, with Akkermansia downregulating genes related to antigen presentation and cell migration. Furthermore, we observed strain specific effects, with Akkermansia H3 upregulating histone and protein binding associated genes and downregulating channel and ion transport genes. Astrocyte pathways that were altered by Akkermansia H3 mono-colonization included upregulation of proliferation pathways and downregulation in cytoskeletal associated genes. Furthermore, animals colonized with type strain Akkermansia and strain H3 had effects on the immune system including elevated splenic γδ-T cells and increased IFNγ production in CD4 + T cells. We also measured intestinal short chain fatty acids and found that both A. muciniphila strains produced proprionate while B. cellulosilyticus produced acetate, proprionate, and isovalerate. Taken together, our study shows that specific members of the intestinal microbiota influence both microglial and astroyctes which may be mediated by changes in short chain fatty acids and peripheral immune signaling.

## 6. The gut microbiome controls reactive astrocytosis during Aβ amyloidosis via propionate-mediated regulation of IL-17.

Accumulating evidence implicates the gut microbiome (GMB) in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently showed that the GMB regulates reactive astrocytosis and Aβ plaque accumulation in a male APPPS1-21 AD mouse model. Yet, the mechanism(s) by which GMB perturbation alters reactive astrocytosis in a manner that reduces Aβ deposition remain unknown. Here, we performed metabolomics on plasma from mice treated with antibiotics (ABX) and identified a significant increase in plasma propionate, a gut-derived short-chain fatty acid, only in male mice. Administration of sodium propionate reduced reactive astrocytosis and Aβ plaques in APPPS1-21 mice, phenocopying the ABX-induced phenotype. Astrocyte-specific RNA-Seq on ABX- and propionate-treated mice showed reduced expression of proinflammatory and increased expression of neurotrophic genes. Next, we performed flow cytometry experiments, in which we found that ABX and propionate decreased peripheral RAR-related orphan receptor-γ+ (Rorγt+) CD4+ (Th17) cells and IL-17 secretion, which positively correlated with reactive astrocytosis. Last, using an IL-17 mAb to deplete IL-17, we found that propionate reduced reactive astrocytosis and Aβ plaques in an IL-17-dependent manner. Together, these results suggest that gut-derived propionate regulates reactive astrocytosis and Aβ amyloidosis by decreasing peripheral Th17 cells and IL-17 release. Thus, propionate treatment or strategies boosting propionate production may represent novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD.

## 7. Prophylactic Administration of Gut Microbiome Metabolites Abrogated Microglial Activation and Subsequent Neuroinflammation in an Experimental Model of Japanese Encephalitis.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are gut microbial metabolic derivatives produced during the fermentation of ingested complex carbohydrates. SCFAs have been widely regarded to have a potent anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective role and have implications in several disease conditions, such as, inflammatory bowel disease, type-2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a neurotropic flavivirus, is associated with life threatening neuro-inflammation and neurological sequelae in infected hosts. In this study, we hypothesize that SCFAs have potential in mitigating JEV pathogenesis. Postnatal day 10 BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with either a SCFA mixture (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) or PBS for a period of 7 days, followed by JEV infection. All mice were observed for onset and progression of symptoms. The brain tissue was collected upon reaching terminal illness for further analysis. SCFA-supplemented JEV-infected mice (SCFA + JEV) showed a delayed onset of symptoms, lower hindlimb clasping score, and decreased weight loss and increased survival by 3 days (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) upon infection as opposed to the PBS-treated JEV-infected animals (JEV). Significant downregulation of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-6, and IFN-Υ in the SCFA + JEV group relative to the JEV-infected control group was observed. Inflammatory mediators, phospho-NF-kB (P-NF-kB) and iba1, showed 2.08 ± 0.1 and 3.132 ± 0.43-fold upregulation in JEV versus 1.19 ± 0.11 and 1.31 ± 0.11-fold in the SCFA + JEV group, respectively. Tissue section analysis exhibited reduced glial activation (JEV group─42 ± 2.15 microglia/ROI; SCFA + JEV group─27.07 ± 1.8 microglia/ROI) in animals that received SCFA supplementation prior to infection as seen from the astrocytic and microglial morphometric analysis. Caspase-3 immunoblotting showed 4.08 ± 1.3-fold upregulation in JEV as compared to 1.03 ± 0.14-fold in the SCFA + JEV group and TUNEL assay showed a reduced cellular death post-JEV infection (JEV-6.4 ± 1.5 cells/ROI and SCFA + JEV-3.7 ± 0.73 cells/ROI). Our study critically contributes to the increasing evidence in support of SCFAs as an anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective agent, we further expand its scope as a potential supplementary intervention in JEV-mediated neuroinflammation.

## 8. The emerging role of microbiota derived SCFAs in neurodegenerative disorders.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), the bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Emerging research highlights how gut microbiota dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the microbial community, is linked to the etiology and pathology of these conditions. Microbiota dysbiosis leads to changes in the production of microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can cross the intestinal barrier and influence the brain either directly or indirectly. Understanding the mechanisms by which dysfunction in the MGBA contributes to neurodegeneration opens potential avenues for novel therapeutic strategies, including microbiota-targeted interventions. This review introduces the MGBA, discusses the role of SCFAs within the MGBA in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, and suggests future research directions.

## 9. The role of short-chain fatty acid in metabolic syndrome and its complications: focusing on immunity and inflammation.

Metabolic syndrome (Mets) is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular, liver, neurological, and reproductive diseases. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), an organismal energy donor, has recently been demonstrated in an increasing number of studies to be an important molecule in ameliorating immuno-inflammation, an important causative factor of Mets, and to improve lipid distribution, blood glucose, and body weight levels in animal models of Mets. This study reviews recent research advances on SCFA in Mets from an immune-inflammatory perspective, including complications dominated by chronic inflammation, as well as the fact that these findings also contribute to the understanding of the specific mechanisms by which gut flora metabolites contribute to metabolic processes in humans. This review proposes an emerging role for SCFA in the inflammatory Mets, followed by the identification of major ambiguities to further understand the anti-inflammatory potential of this substance in Mets. In addition, this study proposes novel strategies to modulate SCFA for the treatment of Mets that may help to mitigate the prognosis of Mets and its complications.

## 10. Association between plasma short-chain fatty acids and inflammation in human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurocognitive disorder: a pilot study.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), key metabolites produced by gut microbiota, have neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases by modulating immune responses. However, their role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains largely unexplored. METHODS: We recruited HAND patients, HIV Control, and healthy controls (HC). Plasma SCFAs and SCFA-producing gut microbiota were quantified via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and fecal metagenomic analysis. Inflammatory cytokine levels were measured using liquid chromatography. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the predictive accuracy of SCFAs for HAND. RESULTS: Plasma SCFAs were significantly reduced in HAND patients, correlating with a decrease in SCFA-producing gut bacteria, such as Prevotella and its related species. Reduced SCFAs were positively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and cognitive impairment, while being negatively correlated with anti-inflammatory cytokines. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that several SCFAs exhibited strong predictive accuracy for HAND status. CONCLUSIONS: SCFAs may influence cognitive function by modulating inflammatory responses, and identifies plasma SCFAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HAND. Further investigation is needed to delineate the mechanisms that SCFAs influence HAND pathology.

## 11. Changes of potential shorty-chain fatty acids producing bacteria in the gut of patients with spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Gut bacteria that potential produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) influences the recovery of motor function in the host in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). We aimed to conduct a review and meta-analysis of the literature on gut microbiota in SCI patients. Following the Preferred Reporting Project for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), we searched Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (WOS) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The search period was from inception to March 31, 2024. We reported standardized mean differences (d) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and used funnel plots and Egger tests to assess publication bias. The subacute of SCI data set revealed the microflora changes in the subacute phase, and meta-analysis summarized the changes in the chronic phase. Eleven studies (720 participants) were included, 2 phyla, 1 order, and 14 genus meta-analyses performed. No substantial heterogeneity was observed, and significant publication bias was not found among the studies included. In the subacute phase of spinal cord injury, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Clostridiales, Faecalbacterium, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, Lachnospira, Dorea, Prevotella, Roseburia, Atopobium, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Blautia increased. Firmicutes and Lactobacillus decreased. In the chronic phase, Firmicutes decreased in the SCI group. Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Blautia, and Eubacterium were found to have a higher average proportion of abundance in patients with SCI compared to non-SCI persons, and Clostridiales, Ruminococcus, Faecalbacterium, Coprococcus, and Lachnospira showed a lower relative abundance in SCI. The genus of potential SCFAs-producing bacteria is lower in the chronic phase of spinal cord injury than in the subacute phase, and gut dysbiosis is present in both the subacute and chronic phases.

## 12. Gut microbiome synthesizes important core metabolites to prevent cognitive decline and mitigate onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: This study explores how gut metabolites, produced through bacterial metabolism in the gut, influence neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Key metabolites such as succinate and short-chain fatty acids signal through the autonomic nervous system and can cross the blood-brain barrier, impacting central nervous system functions. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to examine the role of the gut microbiota in compensating for metabolic deficiencies in AD. By analyzing wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice, the study investigates how the microbiome affects key metabolic processes and whether it can slow AD progression. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing data from the gut microbiomes of APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice and age-matched WT C57BL/6 male mice were analyzed for microbial and metabolite profiles. RESULTS: Alpha and beta diversity analyses showed differences in microbial composition between groups. Partial least squares discriminant analysis and Anosim confirmed distinct microbiome profiles in WT and APP/PS1 mice. At the genus level, Vescimonas was more abundant in WT mice, while Odoribacter, Lacrimispora, Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Alloprevotella were more prevalent in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: While taxonomic differences did not directly link specific microorganisms to AD, functional analysis identified key metabolites-acetyl-CoA, glucose, succinate, lipids, choline, and acetylcholine-that may alleviate energy deficits and synaptic dysfunction. This study suggests that the microbiome may help compensate for AD-related impairments, opening avenues for microbiome-based therapies.

## 13. Critical Review of the Cross-Links Between Dietary Components, the Gut Microbiome, and Depression.

The complex relationship between diet, the gut microbiota, and mental health, particularly depression, has become a focal point of contemporary research. This critical review examines how specific dietary components, such as fiber, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds, shape the gut microbiome and influence microbial metabolism in order to regulate depressive outcomes. These dietary-induced changes in the gut microbiota can modulate the production of microbial metabolites, which play vital roles in gut-brain communication. The gut-brain axis facilitates this communication through neural, immune, and endocrine pathways. Alterations in microbial metabolites can influence central nervous system (CNS) functions by impacting neuroplasticity, inflammatory responses, and neurotransmitter levels-all of which are linked to the onset and course of depression. This review highlights recent findings linking dietary components with beneficial changes in gut microbiota composition and reduced depressive symptoms. We also explore the challenges of individual variability in responses to dietary interventions and the long-term sustainability of these strategies. The review underscores the necessity for further longitudinal and mechanistic studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms through which diet and gut microbiota interactions can be leveraged to mitigate depression, paving the way for personalized nutritional therapies.

## 14. Short-Chain Fatty Acids Are Potential Biomarkers of Immune Regulation in Diabetic Retinopathy.

PURPOSE: Gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiology of diabetes and its complications, yet the mechanistic link of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbes in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unclear. The objective of the current study was to investigate the involvement of SCFAs in the development of DR. METHODS: We collected blood samples from 165 participants with diabetes mellitus and quantified plasma SCFAs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we explored proteomic profiles reflecting host responses to circulating SCFAs using the Olink platform. Using a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model, we evaluated retinal morphological, pathological, and epigenetic changes following a 16-week acetate supplementation. RESULTS: Our data showed that the circulating SCFA profiles of patients with DR significantly differed from those of non-DR controls. Lower levels of acetic, butyric, iso-butyric, and iso-valeric acids were strongly associated with DR risk. Proteomic analysis revealed immune dysregulation in patients with DR, with cytokine expression closely correlated with SCFA levels. In diabetic mice, acetate supplementation improved intestinal barrier function, alleviated retinal thinning, and prevented vessel loss. Moreover, acetate decreased the frequency of CD45+ CD11b+ cells and F4/80+ CD206+ CD11c- cells, indicating a significant inhibition of the overactive immune system in the diabetic retina. Finally, we observed significant changes in retinal DNA methylation, including downregulation of key pathways like vascular endothelial growth factor and nuclear factor-kappa B. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal mechanistic and translationally relevant inter-relationships among the circulating SCFAs, immune regulation, and the development of DR.

## 15. Time-restricted feeding mitigates Alzheimer's disease-associated cognitive impairments via a B. pseudolongum-propionic acid-FFAR3 axis.

Time-restricted feeding (TRF) holds promise for alleviating cognitive decline in aging, albeit the precise mechanism via the gut-brain axis remains elusive. In a clinical trial, we observed, for the first time, that a 4-month TRF ameliorated cognitive impairments among Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Experiments in 5xFAD mice corroborated the gut microbiota-dependent effect of TRF on mitigating cognitive dysfunction, amyloid-beta deposition, and neuroinflammation. Multi-omics integration linked Bifidobacterium pseudolongum (B. pseudolongum) and propionic acid (PA) with key genes in AD pathogenesis. Oral supplementation of B. pseudolongum or PA mimicked TRF's protective effects. Positron emission tomography imaging confirmed PA's blood-brain barrier penetration, while knockdown of the free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3) diminished TRF's cognitive benefits. Notably, we observed a positive correlation between fecal PA and improved cognitive function in an AD cohort, further indicating that TRF enhanced PA production. These findings highlight the microbiota-metabolites-brain axis as pivotal in TRF's cognitive benefits, proposing B. pseudolongum or PA as potential AD therapies.

## 16. Microbiota metabolites affect sleep as drivers of brain‑gut communication (Review).

Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining and improving physical and mental health. However, the prevalence of sleep disorders is increasing in modern society. Recently, the gut‑brain axis has emerged as a prominent focus within the realm of sleep disorder research, with gut microbiota metabolites serving as essential factors in gut‑brain communication. The present study summarizes the emerging connections between gut microbiota metabolites and sleep, mainly focusing on those derived from tryptophan and dietary fiber metabolism. It discusses potential pathways and molecular processes by which sleep interacts with the gut microbiota metabolites, aiming to evaluate the feasibility of using gut microbiota interventions to treat sleep disorders.

## 17. Microbiota-Driven Mechanisms in Multiple Sclerosis: Pathogenesis, Therapeutic Strategies, and Biomarker Potential.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a well-known, chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) involving demyelination and neurodegeneration. Research previously conducted in the area of the gut microbiome has highlighted it as a critical contributor to MS pathogenesis. Changes in the commensal microbiota, or dysbiosis, have been shown to affect immune homeostasis, leading to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and disruption of the gut-brain axis. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of interactions between the gut microbiota and MS, especially focusing on the immunomodulatory actions of microbiota, such as influencing T-cell balance and control of metabolites, e.g., short-chain fatty acids. Various microbial taxa (e.g., Prevotella and Faecalibacterium) were suggested to lay protective roles, whereas Akkermansia muciniphila was associated with disease aggravation. Interventions focusing on microbiota, including probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and dietary therapies to normalize gut microbial homeostasis, suppress inflammation and are proven to improve clinical benefits in MS patients. Alterations in gut microbiota represent opportunities for identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis, disease progression and treatment response monitoring. Further studies need to be conducted to potentially address the interplay between genetic predispositions, environmental cues, and microbiota composition to get the precise mechanisms of the gut-brain axis in MS. In conclusion, the gut microbiota plays a central role in MS pathogenesis and offers potential for novel therapeutic approaches, providing a promising avenue for improving clinical outcomes in MS management.

## 18. Gut microbiota-driven neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease: from mechanisms to therapeutic opportunities.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, and chronic neuroinflammation. While neuroinflammation-mediated by microglial and astrocyte activation-has long been considered a secondary response to Aβ pathology, emerging evidence positions it as a primary driver of cognitive decline. Notably, the gut microbiota, through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), is crucial in modulating neuroinflammation. Dysbiosis disrupts gut barrier integrity, promotes systemic inflammation, and exacerbates neuroinflammatory responses, thereby accelerating AD progression. Recent advances reveal that gut microbiota-derived metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides) directly influence microglial activation and Aβ aggregation. These findings have opened new therapeutic possibilities, with microbiota-targeted approaches such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation demonstrating promising neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies by reducing neuroinflammation and preserving cognitive function. However, translating these findings into clinical applications requires further validation through randomized controlled trials. This review summarizes the current understanding of gut microbiota-driven neuroinflammation in AD, from molecular mechanisms to potential therapeutic strategies. Targeting the MGBA represents a paradigm shift in AD management, emphasizing the modulation of neuroinflammation and pathological progression through gut microbiota interventions. The discussion also addresses existing research challenges and outlines future directions to advance this promising field.

## 19. How the gut microbiota impacts neurodegenerative diseases by modulating CNS immune cells.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles are two key histological features resulting in progressive and irreversible neuronal loss and cognitive decline. The macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) belong to the innate immune system and comprise parenchymal microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) at the CNS interfaces (leptomeninges, perivascular space and choroid plexus). Microglia and CAMs have received attention as they may play a key role in disease onset and progression e. g., by clearing amyloid beta (Aβ) through phagocytosis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that human microglia and CAMs express numerous risk genes for AD, further highlighting their potentially critical role in AD pathogenesis. Microglia and CAMs are tightly controlled by environmental factors, such as the host microbiota. Notably, it was further reported that the composition of the gut microbiota differed between AD patients and healthy individuals. Hence, emerging studies have analyzed the impact of gut bacteria in different preclinical mouse models for AD as well as in clinical studies, potentially enabling promising new therapeutic options.

## 20. Examination of Anti-Inflammatory Effects After Propionate Supplementation in the R6/2 Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease.

Huntington's disease is a progressive, untreatable neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the Huntingtin gene. Next to neurodegeneration, altered immune activation is involved in disease progression. Since central nervous system inflammation and dysfunction of immune cells are recognized as driving characteristics, immunomodulation might represent an additional therapeutic strategy. Short-chain fatty acids were known to have immunomodulatory effects in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this study, R6/2 mice were treated daily with 150 mM propionate. Survival range, body weight, and motor abilities were monitored. In striatal and cortical samples, neuronal survival was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining of NeuN-positive cells and expression levels of BDNF mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction. As inflammatory marker TNFα mRNA and IL-6 mRNA were quantified by rtPCR, iNOS-expressing cells were counted in immunologically stained brain slides. Microglial activation was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining of IBA1-positive cells and total IBA1 protein by Western Blot, in addition, SPI1 mRNA expression was quantified by rtPCR. Except for clasping behavior, propionate treatment did neither improve the clinical course nor mediated neuronal protection in R6/2 mice. Yet there was a mild anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS, with (i) reduction in SPI1-mRNA levels, (ii) reduced iNOS positive cells in the motor cortex, and (iii) normalized TNFα-mRNA in the motor cortex of propionate-treated R6/2 mice. Thus, Short-chain fatty acids, as an environmental factor in the diet, may slightly alleviate symptoms by down-regulating inflammatory factors in the central nervous system. However, they cannot prevent clinical disease progression or neuronal loss.

## 21. Exploring the microbiota-gut-brain axis: impact on brain structure and function. Alcohol Use Disorder and the Gut-Brain Axis: A Narrative Review of the Role of Gut Microbiota and Implications for Treatment.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) plays a significant role in the maintenance of brain structure and function. The MGBA serves as a conduit between the CNS and the ENS, facilitating communication between the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain via diverse pathways. In the initial stages of this review, we will examine the way how MGBA affects neurogenesis, neuronal dendritic morphology, axonal myelination, microglia structure, brain blood barrier (BBB) structure and permeability, and synaptic structure. Furthermore, we will review the potential mechanistic pathways of neuroplasticity through MGBA influence. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a pivotal role in the MGBA, where they can modify the BBB. We will therefore discuss how SCFAs can influence microglia, neuronal, and astrocyte function, as well as their role in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Subsequently, we will examine the technical strategies employed to study MGBA interactions, including using germ-free (GF) animals, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and antibiotics-induced dysbiosis. Finally, we will examine how particular bacterial strains can affect brain structure and function. By gaining a deeper understanding of the MGBA, it may be possible to facilitate research into microbial-based pharmacological interventions and therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to deleterious physical and social consequences. Recent research has highlighted not only the effect of alcohol on the gut microbiome, but also the role of the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis in the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorder. This review provides an overview of the reciprocal relationship between alcohol consumption and the gut microbiome, including the effects of alcohol on gut microbial composition, changes in gut microbial metabolites in response to alcohol consumption, and how gut microbial metabolites may modulate alcohol use behavior. We also discuss the gut-mediated mechanisms of neuroinflammation that contribute to and result from AUD, including disruption of the intestinal barrier, toll-like receptor signaling, and the activation of glial cells and immune cells. Finally, we review the current evidence on gut microbial-directed therapies for AUD and discuss the implications of this research for our understanding of the pathophysiology of AUD and future research directions.

## 22. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation from Methionine-Restricted Diet Mouse Donors Improves Alzheimer's Learning and Memory Abilities Through Short-Chain Fatty Acids.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by impaired cognitive functions, particularly in learning and memory, owing to complex and diverse mechanisms. Methionine restriction (MR) has been found to exert a mitigating effect on brain oxidative stress to improve AD. However, the bidirectional crosstalk between the gut and brain through which MR enhances learning and memory in AD, as well as the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MR mice on AD mice, remains underexplored. In this study, APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice were used and an FMT experiment was conducted. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, targeted metabolomics, and microbial metabolite short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of feces samples were analyzed. The results showed that MR reversed the reduction in SCFAs induced by AD, and further activated the free fatty acid receptors, FFAR2 and FFAR3, as well as the transport protein MCT1, thereby signaling to the brain to mitigate inflammation and enhance the learning and memory capabilities. Furthermore, the FMT experiment from methionine-restricted diet mouse donors showed that mice receiving FMT ameliorated Alzheimer's learning and memory ability through SCFAs. This study offers novel non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies for AD prevention.

## 23. The microbiota-gut-brain axis and central nervous system diseases: from mechanisms of pathogenesis to therapeutic strategies.

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in metabolic processes associated with host brain function. Emerging research is progressively uncovering the intricate and multifaceted relationship between the gut and the brain. The gut microbiota significantly influences immune responses, secondary metabolism, and symbiosis with the host, thereby facilitating the production of essential metabolites, neurotransmitters, and other neuroactive compounds that impact the development and treatment of central nervous system disorders. This article delineates the communication pathways and mechanisms linking the microbiota, gut, and brain, providing a comprehensive overview of current research on how the gut microbiota affects nervous system function. Furthermore, it examines factors that can alter the gut microbiota and influence metabolite profiles, as well as current intervention strategies aimed at enhancing gut-brain communication, mitigating adverse triggers that disrupt the gut microbiota, and minimizing neuro-pathological changes.

## 24. Inhibition of levodopa metabolism to dopamine by honokiol short-chain fatty acid derivatives may enhance therapeutic efficacy in Parkinson's disease.

This study investigates the antimicrobial properties of honokiol (HNK), a naturally occurring polyphenol, when conjugated with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate. We examined the effects of HNK-SCFA ester conjugates on Enterococcus faecalis, a gut bacterium that metabolizes levodopa, a drug used to manage Parkinson's disease symptoms. Our findings indicate that HNK-SCFA-esters (e.g., HNK-acetate, HNK-propionate, HNK-butyrate, and HNK-hexanoate) inhibit E. faecalis growth in a dose-dependent manner, followed by a temporary recovery period during which levodopa remains intact and unmetabolized. Notably, HNK-SCFAs exhibit enhanced cellular permeability and are hydrolyzed within bacterial cells, releasing HNK and SCFAs. These results suggest that HNK-SCFAs may reversibly modulate the gut metabolism of levodopa to dopamine, potentially enhancing its therapeutic efficacy in treating Parkinson's disease.

## 25. The role of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics: cellular and molecular pathways activated on glial cells in Alzheimer's disease.

Supplementation with prebiotics and probiotics can modulate the intestinal microbiota, returning it to a more physiological state; therefore, they can be considered as a possible treatment in many prevalent conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 70% of cases. The neuropathological features of AD include neuritic plaques (extracellular deposits of the beta-amyloid protein, Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (resulting from hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein), a predominantly cholinergic synaptic decrease, and the presence of inflammatory markers, all these characteristics together trigger the neurodegenerative process and cognitive deterioration. The etiology of AD is multifactorial, however, in recent years evidence has been shown on the significant association between dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. In the present review, we will discuss the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of AD, as well as the underlying mechanisms that trigger the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics in neuroinflammation. Our attention will focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by astrocytes and microglia, cells involved in mediating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD.

## 26. Could a Mediterranean Diet Modulate Alzheimer's Disease Progression? The Role of Gut Microbiota and Metabolite Signatures in Neurodegeneration.

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, represent a growing global health crisis, yet current treatment strategies remain primarily palliative. Recent studies have shown that neurodegeneration through complex interactions within the gut-brain axis largely depends on the gut microbiota and its metabolites. This review explores the intricate molecular mechanisms linking gut microbiota dysbiosis to cognitive decline, emphasizing the impact of microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, on neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and amyloid-β and tau pathology. The paper highlights major microbiome signatures associated with Alzheimer's disease, detailing their metabolic pathways and inflammatory crosstalk. Dietary interventions have shown promise in modulating gut microbiota composition, potentially mitigating neurodegenerative processes. This review critically examines the influence of dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean and Western diets, on microbiota-mediated neuroprotection. Bioactive compounds like prebiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, and polyphenols exhibit neuroprotective effects by modulating gut microbiota and reducing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, it discusses emerging microbiome-based therapeutic strategies, including probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as potential interventions for slowing Alzheimer's progression. Despite these advances, several knowledge gaps remain, including interindividual variability in microbiome responses to dietary interventions and the need for large-scale, longitudinal studies. The study proposes an integrative, precision medicine approach, incorporating microbiome science into Alzheimer's treatment paradigms. Ultimately, cognizance of the gut-brain axis at a mechanistic level could unlock novel therapeutic avenues, offering a non-invasive, diet-based strategy for managing neurodegeneration and improving cognitive health.

## 27. The Kynurenine Pathway in Gut Permeability and Inflammation.

The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a crucial communication network linking the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS). The gut microbiota significantly influences metabolic, immune, and neural functions by generating a diverse array of bioactive compounds that modulate brain function and maintain homeostasis. A pivotal mechanism in this communication is the kynurenine pathway, which metabolises tryptophan into various derivatives, including neuroactive and neurotoxic compounds. Alterations in gut microbiota composition can increase gut permeability, triggering inflammation and neuroinflammation, and contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders. This review elucidates the mechanisms by which changes in gut permeability may lead to systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, with a focus on the kynurenine pathway. We explore how probiotics can modulate the kynurenine pathway and reduce neuroinflammation, highlighting their potential as therapeutic interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders. The review integrates experimental data, discusses the balance between neurotoxic and neuroprotective kynurenine metabolites, and examines the role of probiotics in regulating inflammation, cognitive development, and gut-brain axis functions. The insights provided aim to guide future research and therapeutic strategies for mitigating GI complaints and their neurological consequences.

## 28. Beyond weight loss: exploring the neurological ramifications of altered gut microbiota post-bariatric surgery.

This review discusses findings related to neurological disorders, gut microbiota, and bariatric surgery, focusing on neurotransmitters, neuroendocrine, the pathophysiology of bacteria contributing to disorders, and possible therapeutic interventions. Research on neurotransmitters suggests that their levels are heavily influenced by gut microbiota, which may link them to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Depression, and Autism spectrum disorder. The pathophysiology of bacteria that reach and influence the central nervous system has been documented. Trends in microbiota are often observed in specific neurological disorders, with a prominence of pro-inflammatory bacteria and a reduction in anti-inflammatory types. Furthermore, bariatric surgery has been shown to alter microbiota profiles similar to those observed in neurological disorders. Therapeutic interventions, including fecal microbiota transplants and probiotics, have shown potential to alleviate neurological symptoms. We suggest a framework for future studies that integrates knowledge from diverse research areas, employs rigorous methodologies, and includes long-trial clinical control groups.

## 29. The Gut-Brain-Microbiota Connection and Its Role in Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of complex neurodevelopmental conditions with a heterogeneous and multifactorial etiology that is not yet fully understood. Among the various factors that may contribute to ASD development, alterations in the gut microbiota have been increasingly recognized. Microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract play a crucial role in the gut-brain axis (GBA), affecting nervous system development and behavior. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the microbiota, has been linked to both behavioral and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in individuals with ASD. The microbiota interacts with the central nervous system through mechanisms such as the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the regulation of neurotransmitters, and immune system modulation. Alterations in its composition, including reduced diversity or an overabundance of specific bacterial taxa, have been associated with the severity of ASD symptoms. Dietary modifications, such as gluten-free or antioxidant-rich diets, have shown potential for improving gut health and alleviating behavioral symptoms. Probiotics, with their anti-inflammatory properties, may support neural health and reduce neuroinflammation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is being considered, particularly for individuals with persistent GI symptoms. It has shown promising outcomes in enhancing microbial diversity and mitigating GI and behavioral symptoms. However, its limitations should be considered, as discussed in this narrative review. Further research is essential to better understand the long-term effects and safety of these therapies. Emphasizing the importance of patient stratification and phenotype characterization is crucial for developing personalized treatment strategies that account for individual microbiota profiles, genetic predispositions, and coexisting conditions. This approach could lead to more effective interventions for individuals with ASD. Recent findings suggest that gut microbiota may play a key role in innovative therapeutic approaches to ASD management.

## 30. High-throughput workflow for cultivation and characterization of gut microbiota strains with anti-inflammatory properties and metabolite signature associated with gut-brain communication.

The gut microbiota is deeply interconnected with the brain, a phenomenon often referred to as the gut-brain axis. Dysfunction in the microbiota-gut-brain axis can cause various neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with chronic inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Therefore, cultivation of anaerobic human gut microbiota strains, and characterization of their safety status and immunomodulatory potential could contribute to deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain communication and revealed their biotherapeutic potential. However, poor cultivability of gut microbiota members, makes research into their physiological role challenging. Hence, we report a high-throughput workflow based on targeted cultivation linked to metagenome sequencing, combined with the bioinformatic search for gut members with anti-inflammatory properties which produce the most important microbial metabolites that affect brain function. With this approach, we isolated 147 bacterial strains, and 41 were characterized for their immunomodulatory status with 12 strains showing immunosuppressive features with ability of producing brain important metabolites. Through this workflow we established the best growing conditions essential for cultivation, archiving, phenotyping, and characterization of anaerobic gut bacteria important for microbiota-gut-brain-axis research, and characterized the safety and probiotic potential of 7 extremely oxygen-sensitive strains.

## 31. Perturbations in the microbiota-gut-brain axis shaped by social status loss.

Social status is closely linked to physiological and psychological states. Loss of social dominance can lead to brain disorders such as depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The gut microbiota can sense stress and contribute to brain disorders via the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Here, using a forced loss paradigm to demote dominant mice to subordinate ranks, we find that stress alters the composition and function of the gut microbiota, increasing Muribaculaceae abundance and enhancing butanoate metabolism, and gut microbial depletion resists forced loss-induced hierarchical demotion and behavioral alteration. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) indicates that social status loss primarily affected interneurons, altering GABAergic synaptic transmission. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) reveals modules linked to forced loss in the gut microbiota, colon, PFC, and PFC interneurons, suggesting changes in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the glutamatergic synapse. Our findings provide evidence for MGBA perturbations induced by social status loss, offering potential intervention targets for related brain disorders.

## 32. Neurobiological and Microbiota Alterations After Bariatric Surgery: Implications for Hunger, Appetite, Taste, and Long-Term Metabolic Health.

Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective intervention for obesity, inducing significant neurobiological and gut microbiota changes that influence hunger, appetite, taste perception, and long-term metabolic health. This narrative review examines these alterations by analyzing recent findings from clinical and preclinical studies, including neuroimaging, microbiome sequencing, and hormonal assessments. BS modulates appetite-regulating hormones, reducing ghrelin while increasing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), leading to enhanced satiety and decreased caloric intake. Neuroimaging studies reveal structural and functional changes in brain regions involved in reward processing and cognitive control, contributing to reduced cravings and altered food choices. Additionally, BS reshapes the gut microbiota, increasing beneficial species such as Akkermansia muciniphila, which influence metabolic pathways through short-chain fatty acid production and bile acid metabolism. These findings highlight the complex interplay between the gut and the brain in post-surgical metabolic regulation. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for optimizing post-operative care, including nutritional strategies and behavioral interventions. Future research should explore how these changes impact long-term outcomes, guiding the development of targeted therapies to enhance the recovery and quality of life for BS patients.

## 33. Targeting gut microbiota as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases.

Recent evidence suggests a more important role of the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) given its relationship through the microbiota-gut-brain as an active communication system aiding in maintaining homeostasis between the brain and the gut. This review focuses on how modulation of gut microbiota can serves as a therapeutic strategy for NDDs, emphasizing the neuroprotective effects of probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits, and their interaction with gut-microbiota influences neurogenesis, neurotransmitter regulation, and neuroinflammation. Recent advancements, including germ-free animal models, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and diverse probiotic strains, have revealed the underlying mechanisms linking gut health to brain function. Notably, several Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species have been shown to exert neuroprotective effects via the upregulation of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and enhancing mitochondrial function through reducing the impacts of oxidative stress. Interestingly, FMT has exhibited a degree of success in overcoming cognitive impairment and motor deficits in preclinical studies and clinical trials. However, further research is warranted to explore its therapeutic potential in humans. Overall, this review highlights the significant role of gut microbiota in NDDs and advocates for gut-targeted interventions as innovative approaches to mitigate these diseases.

## 34. Cross-talk between microbiota-gut-brain axis and blood pressure regulation.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), is a widespread condition affecting one in three adults globally. Despite the availability of treatment options, 50% of hypertensive patients in countries such as Australia fail to achieve adequate BP control, often due to a lack of response to current therapies. Diet plays a crucial role in BP regulation. A high-fibre diet reduces BP through the gut microbiome and the production of microbial metabolites known as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, the mechanisms of BP regulation by SCFAs remained still unclear. A novel hypothesis we explore in this review is that these microbial metabolites may regulate BP via the activation of central mechanisms, a phenomenon called the gut-brain axis. While substantial evidence in animal models and humans supports the protective role of SCFAs in hypertension, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. SCFA stimulates the release of neurotransmitters and hormones such as serotonin, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY by enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. These hormones bind to their receptors on the peripheral nervous system nerves, such as the vagus and spinal nerves, conveying information to the brain. The mechanisms by which information is relayed from the gut microbiome to the brain likely involve the immune system and gut-derived neurotransmitters and hormones. A deeper understanding of these pathways and mechanisms will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.

## 35. The microbial guardians: Unveiling the role of gut microbiota in shaping neurodegenerative disease.

The gut microbiota, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the digestive tract, plays a pivotal role in human health. Recent studies have highlighted its significant impact on neurodegenerative diseases, conditions that pose profound challenges to affected individuals and society at large. This review explores the intricate relationship between gut microbiota and the progression of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. We delve into the dynamic ecosystem of gut microbiota, examining factors influencing its composition and the bidirectional communication established via the gut-brain axis. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota can modulate neurodegenerative disease progression through mechanisms including inflammatory responses, production of neuroactive substances, and regulation of neurotransmitters. Furthermore, we discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. While promising, these interventions face challenges and limitations that must be addressed through ongoing research. Understanding the role of gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes.

## 36. Unraveling the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Microbiome, Inflammation, and Emerging Therapeutic Approaches.

The gut-liver-brain axis (GLB axis) plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic, immune, and neurological homeostasis. The gut microbiota influences systemic health through its metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), and tryptophan (Trp) derivatives, which regulate immune function, lipid metabolism, and neurotransmitter balance. Dysbiosis is an imbalance in gut microbiota that has been implicated in metabolic dysfuntion associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD), and neuroinflammatory conditions such as schizophrenia. Increased gut permeability allows microbial byproducts like lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) to enter the liver and brain, activating inflammatory pathways that contribute to disease progression. Moreover, hepatic dysfunction can lead to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments. Understanding the interplay between microbial metabolites and host physiology provides insight into novel therapeutic interventions. Strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transfer (FMT), and postbiotics offer potential treatments to restore gut eubiosis and mitigate disease severity. This review highlights the mechanistic role of the GLB axis in health and disease, emphasizing microbiome-targeted therapies as a promising avenue for managing metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04823676, NCT02496390, NCT06024681, NCT02721264.

## 37. Mechanistic Links Between Gut Dysbiosis, Insulin Resistance, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition frequently associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, gut dysbiosis, and metabolic dysfunctions such as insulin resistance (IR). Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may influence both metabolic and neurological processes through the gut–brain–metabolic axis. This review explores the molecular mechanisms linking dysbiosis, IR, and ASD, focusing on pathways such as TLR/NF-κB activation, PI3K/Akt/mTOR disruption, and the action of microbial metabolites, like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We discuss how dysbiosis may contribute to increased intestinal permeability, systemic inflammation, and neuroimmune activation, ultimately affecting brain development and behavior. Common microbial alterations in ASD and IR—including increased Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, and Alistipes, and reduced Bifidobacterium and butyrate-producing genera—suggest a shared pathophysiology. We also highlight potential therapeutic strategies, such as microbiota modulation, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) treatment, and dietary interventions. Understanding these interconnected mechanisms may support the development of microbiota-targeted approaches for individuals with ASD metabolic comorbidities.

## 38. Severe Cognitive Decline in Long-term Care Is Related to Gut Microbiome Production of Metabolites Involved in Neurotransmission, Immunomodulation, and Autophagy.

Aging-associated cognitive decline affects more than half of those in long-term residential aged care. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiome-host interactions influence the effects of modifiable risk factors. We investigated the relationship between gut microbiome characteristics and severity of cognitive impairment (CI) in 159 residents of long-term aged care. Severe CI was associated with a significantly increased abundance of proinflammatory bacterial species, including Methanobrevibacter smithii and Alistipes finegoldii, and decreased relative abundance of beneficial bacterial clades. Severe CI was associated with increased microbial capacity for methanogenesis, and reduced capacity for synthesis of short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid, and amino acids required for neuroprotective lysosomal activity. These relationships were independent of age, sex, antibiotic exposure, and diet. Our findings implicate multiple gut microbiome-brain pathways in aging-associated cognitive decline, including inflammation, neurotransmission, and autophagy, and highlight the potential to predict and prevent cognitive decline through microbiome-targeted strategies.

## 39. Gut microbiota: A new window for the prevention and treatment of neuropsychiatric disease.

Under normal physiological conditions, gut microbiota and host mutually coexist. They play key roles in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, absorption, and metabolism, as well as promoting the development of the central nervous system (CNS) and emotional regulation. The dysregulation of gut microbiota homeostasis has attracted significant research interest, specifically in its impact on neurological and psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the important role of the gut- brain axis in conditions including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and depression. This review aims to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms by which gut microbiota affect the progression of CNS disorders via the gut-brain axis. Additionally, we discuss the current research landscape, identify gaps, and propose future directions for microbial interventions against these diseases. Finally, we provide a theoretical reference for clinical treatment strategies and drug development for AD, PD, and depression.

## 40. Gut microbiota and autism spectrum disorder: advances in dietary intervention strategies based on the microbiota-gut-brain axis mechanism.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is primarily characterized by deficits in social interaction, impaired communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has been steadily increasing, establishing it as one of the leading causes of disability among children worldwide. Although the precise pathogenesis of ASD remains unclear, factors such as genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, immune dysregulation, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities are collectively believed to contribute to its onset. In recent years, the gut microbiota has emerged as a promising area of research in neurobiology, particularly in relation to advances in understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) mechanism. Studies have shown that children with ASD exhibit significant dysbiosis in their gut microbiota, which may affect brain function via the MGBA, ultimately leading to abnormal behaviors and impaired emotional regulation. This review summarizes the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of ASD, examining how alterations in gut permeability, dysregulated microbial metabolites, and immune dysfunction may influence ASD symptomatology. In particular, the role of the MGBA in modulating immune-inflammatory responses, neurodevelopment, and behavioral regulation has become a focal point of ASD research. Building on this foundation, the review further summarizes dietary intervention strategies grounded in the MGBA theory, emphasizing their potential to restore gut microbial composition, modulate immune responses, and enhance metabolic function, thereby offering novel therapeutic perspectives for ASD.

## 41. Estradiol metabolism by gut microbiota in women's depression pathogenesis: inspiration from nature.

The recurrence and treatment resistance of depression remain significant issues, primarily due to an inadequate understanding of its pathogenesis. Recent scientific evidence indicates that gut microbiota influence estradiol metabolism and are associated with the development of depression in nonpremenopausal women. Integrating existing studies on the regulation of estradiol metabolism by microorganisms in nature and the relevance of its degradation products to depression, recent scientific explorations have further elucidated the key mechanisms by which gut microbiota catabolize estradiol through specific metabolic pathways. These emerging scientific findings suggest that the unique metabolic effects of gut microbiota on estradiol may be one of the central drivers in the onset and course of depression in non-menopausal women.

## 42. The Role and Mechanisms of Probiotic Supplementation on Depressive Symptoms: A Narrative Review.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The microbiota-gut-brain-axis (MGBA) plays a role in the aetiology of mental disorders. Depression, a leading cause of disability worldwide, may be improved by probiotics. The aim of this narrative review is to investigate and synthesize the current evidence linking probiotic food supplementation with depressive symptomology. RECENT FINDINGS: The gut and the brain communicate and interact via the MGBA through inflammation and the immune system, short chain fatty acid production, neuronal innervation and activation as well as endocrine and neurotransmitter modulation. Dysregulation of gut-brain pathways are caused by gut dysbiosis and implicated in the onset, persistence and exacerbation of depression related symptoms. Modulation of the gut microbiota via administration of probiotics has shown to reduce depressive symptom severity with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains being the most reported. Probiotics may produce greater benefits in mild depression rather than in chronic, treatment resistant depression. Probiotic supplementation is a promising and safe approach for the prevention of severe depressive disorders in high-risk individuals such as people with subthreshold depression. However, the mechanistic pathways of the MGBA require further investigation and additional human clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the role of probiotics on depression.

## 43. Gut Microbiota and Mental Health: A Comprehensive Review of Gut-Brain Interactions in Mood Disorders.

The human gut flora of trillions of bacteria is vital for general health and greatly influences digestion, immune system function, and brain development. Through neuronal, hormonal, and immunological channels, the gut-brain axis (GBA), a bidirectional communication network, links the gut microbiota to the central nervous system (CNS). This relationship has been linked to affective diseases, including depression and anxiety, as well as mental health issues. This review explores the intricate relationship between gut bacteria and mood disorders, focusing on how gut microbiota-host interactions, immune system modulation, and neurotransmitter control support mental health. The function of important microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in preserving blood-brain barrier integrity and modulating neuroinflammation is covered in this review. It also examines the bidirectional impact between gut health and mental health, including how dysbiosis could aggravate mood disorders and how depressed states might change the composition of gut bacteria. Furthermore, we discuss how psychotropic drugs affect gut flora and consider other elements such as nutrition and lifestyle that affect gut microbiome composition. Potential paths for treating mood disorders through gut microbiota modification are presented as emerging treatment techniques, including probiotics, nutritional therapies, and precision medicine. The development of new therapeutic approaches for mood disorders depends on the awareness of the GBA. Gut bacteria significantly affect mental health through immune modulation, neurotransmitter generation, and other intricate processes. Future studies should concentrate on large, varied populations to better understand these interactions and to create customized treatments that combine gut microbiota modulation with conventional mental health therapies.

## 44. The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Modulating Signaling Pathways and Oxidative Stress in Glioma Therapies.

Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), especially gliomas, pose a significant clinical challenge due to their aggressive nature and limited therapeutic options. Emerging research highlights the critical role of the gut microbiota in regulating CNS health and disease. The composition of the gut microbiota is essential for maintaining CNS homeostasis, as it modulates immune responses, oxidative status, and neuroinflammation. The microbiota-gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network, plays a pivotal role in cancer and CNS disease treatment, exerting its influence through neural, endocrine, immunological, and metabolic pathways. Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiota influences the solidification of the tumor microenvironment and that dysbiosis may promote glioma development by modulating systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which contributes to tumorigenesis and CNS tumor progression. This review interrogates the impact of the gut microbiota on glioma, focusing on critical pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and Kynurenine/AhR that drive tumor proliferation, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. Furthermore, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies, including probiotics and microbiota-based interventions, which show potential in modulating these pathways and enhancing immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. By focusing on the multifaceted interactions between the gut microbiota, oxidative stress, and CNS tumors, this review highlights the potential of microbiota-targeted therapies and their manipulation to complement and enhance current treatments.

## 45. Altered Gut Microbiota Contributes to Acute-Respiratory-Distress-Syndrome-Related Depression through Microglial Neuroinflammation.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors often suffer from long-term psychiatric disorders such as depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found marked alterations in the composition of gut microbiota in both ARDS patients and mouse models. We investigated the role of one of the dramatically changed bacteria-Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), whose abundance was negatively correlated with depression phenotypes in both ARDS patients and ARDS mouse models. Specifically, while fecal transplantation from ARDS patients into naive mice led to depressive-like behaviors, microglial activation, and intestinal barrier destruction, colonization of AKK or oral administration of its metabolite-propionic acid-alleviated these deficits in ARDS mice. Mechanistically, AKK and propionic acid decreased microglial activation and neuronal inflammation through inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor κB signaling pathway. Together, these results reveal a microbiota-dependent mechanism for ARDS-related depression and provide insight for developing a novel preventative strategy for ARDS-related psychiatric symptoms.

## 46. The human gut microbiota is associated with host lifestyle: a comprehensive narrative review.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota serves as a critical interface between lifestyle factors and host physiology. Despite extensive research on individual domains including diet, sleep, and exercise, an integrated understanding of their synergistic effects on microbial communities remains incomplete. This knowledge gap limits our ability to develop targeted microbiome-based interventions for metabolic and immune-related disorders. METHODS: To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of peer-reviewed literature from 2000 to present, identified through systematic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using key terms related to gut microbiota and lifestyle interventions. Our analysis focused on studies incorporating microbiome profiling techniques, controlled lifestyle interventions, and multi-omics data integration. The review prioritized mechanistic insights from both clinical and preclinical investigations while critically assessing methodological approaches across the field. RESULTS: High-fiber dietary patterns consistently promoted the abundance of beneficial, short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, though with notable inter-individual variation. Circadian rhythm disruption was associated with reduced microbial diversity and expansion of pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa, paralleling increases in systemic inflammation markers. Athletic populations demonstrated unique microbial signatures characterized by enhanced metabolic potential, with distinct taxonomic profiles emerging across different sport disciplines. CONCLUSION: This work synthesizes current evidence into a novel framework for understanding lifestyle-microbiota interactions, while identifying key challenges in study design and data interpretation. We propose standardized methodological approaches for future investigations and outline translational strategies for personalized microbiota modulation. These insights advance the potential for targeted microbial interventions to optimize metabolic and immune health outcomes.

## 47. Multimodal Interventions Targeting Gut Microbiota and Microbial Metabolites in Cognitive Impairment.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that alterations in gut microbiota and microbial metabolites are associated with cognitive decline, highlighting the gut-brain axis as a potential therapeutic target. This narrative review explores current evidence on the relationship between gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and MCI. It summarizes intervention strategies including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotic, fecal microbiota transplantation, dietary modifications, medicinal herbs, phytochemicals, metformin, and lifestyle factors. Probiotic strains such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have shown cognitive benefits. Adherence to the Mediterranean and MIND diets, as well as metformin use, is associated with lower MCI risk. Novel strategies, including plant-based compounds and nature exposure, show promise in modulating gut microbiota and improving cognitive outcomes. Gut microbiota modulation represents a promising avenue for early intervention in MCI. Personalized, multifactorial approaches based on individual microbiome profiles may enhance prevention and management strategies. However, more high-quality clinical trials are needed to establish evidence-based guidelines.

## 48. Coconut oil derived medium-chain triglycerides ameliorated memory deficits via promoting neurite outgrowth and maintaining gut homeostasis in 5×FAD mice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neurite atrophy, neuronal loss, and memory impairment. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), a type of fatty acid predominantly found in coconut oil, have been shown to improve metabolic syndrome as well as cognitive performance via ketone production in humans. Here, we investigated the protective effects of MCT on neurite atrophy and memory deficits in 5×FAD mice and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. First, virgin coconut oil (VCO), refined, bleached, and deodorized coconut oil (RBDCO), and MCT were orally administered to 6-8 months old 5×FAD mice for 9 consecutive weeks, the effects on cognition were then evaluated. MCT demonstrated superior effects compared to RBDCO and VCO in reducing Aβ levels, inhibiting hyperactivated microglia and astroglia, protecting neurons, and mitigating memory decline. Further, metagenomic analysis and RT-qPCR results revealed that MCT intervention increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia, reduced intestinal permeability, and elevated the concentration of short-chain fatty acids in the brain. Additionally, MCT treatment significantly protected primary cortical neurons against Aβ25-35-induced apoptosis and promoted neurite regeneration. Transcriptome and RT-qPCR data suggested that Ucp1 and Flor1 may be potential targets through which MCT exerts its neuroprotective effects. Our findings suggest that MCT may help prevent the progression of AD by promoting neurite outgrowth and maintaining gut homeostasis in 5×FAD mice, offering a theoretical foundation for the development of dietary therapies for AD.

## 49. Monocyte-Platelet Aggregates Are Major Source of BDNF after Bacterial Stimulation of Human Peripheral Blood Immune Cells.

The gut microbiota and the immune system are closely connected, influencing early-life brain development. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), crucial for neuronal development, has been demonstrated to be produced by certain immune cells. However, the modulation of BDNF during bacterial antigen and metabolite challenge remains elusive. We investigate the effects of bacterial-derived antigens and metabolites on BDNF secretion in human PBMCs. Although BDNF levels were altered during stimulation, a specific cellular origin of BDNF within PBMCs was indeterminate. Positive magnetic separation of monocytes eliminated both the stimulant-induced BDNF secretion and reduced monocyte-platelet aggregates. Conversely, elevated platelet counts significantly increased BDNF levels, indicating that platelets, when interacting with monocytes and exposed to bacterial antigens, are likely the dominant source of BDNF in PBMC cultures. As previously described, platelets are a crucial source of circulating peripheral blood BDNF. Our findings emphasize the importance of the interplay between immune-blood cell complexes during microbial stimulation in regulating BDNF levels. This highlights the necessity of investigating such interactions to better understand the early-life gut-brain axis.

## 50. The Beneficial Effects of Lactobacillus Strains on Gut Microbiome in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Growing evidence suggests that the gut-brain axis influences brain function, particularly the role of intestinal microbiota in modulating cognitive processes. Probiotics may alter brain function and behavior by modulating gut microbiota, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this review is to systematically review the current literature exploring the effects of probiotic supplementation on gut microbiota and cognitive function in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Scopus to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to 20 August 2024. The search focused on comparing outcomes between intervention and control/placebo groups. Data searches, article selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration no: CRD42023446796. RESULTS: Data from four RCTs involving 293 Individuals (AD and MCI patients) receiving mainly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains showed some beneficial effects on cognitive function, altered gut microbiota composition, and positively affected metabolic biomarkers. However, variability in microbiota assessment across studies limits the interpretation of results. The limited number and quality of the existing studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from the data. Additional high-quality research is clearly needed. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics show promise as an adjunctive intervention for cognitive decline, but larger, long-term trials are needed to confirm their efficacy and clinical applicability in neurodegenerative diseases like AD.

## 51. Microbial diversity and fitness in the gut-brain axis: influences on developmental risk for Alzheimer's disease.

The gut-brain axis (GBA) denotes the dynamic and bidirectional communication system that connects the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (CNS). This review explored this axis, focusing on the role of microbial diversity and fitness in maintaining gastrointestinal health and preventing neurodegeneration, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Gut dysbiosis, characterized by the imbalance in populations of beneficial and harmful bacteria, has been associated with increased systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and the progression of AD through pathogenic mechanisms involving amyloid deposition, tauopathy, and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Emerging evidence highlighted the therapeutic potential of probiotics, dietary interventions, and intermittent fasting in restoring microbial balance, reducing inflammation, and minimizing neurodegenerative risks. Probiotics and synbiotics are promising in helping improve cognitive function and metabolic health, while dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet were linked to decreased neuroinflammation and enhanced gut-brain communication. Despite significant advancement, further research is needed to elucidate the specific microbial strains, metabolites, and mechanisms influencing brain health. Future studies employing longitudinal designs and advanced omics technologies are essential to developing targeted microbiome-based therapies for managing AD-related disorders.

## 52. The role of fecal microbiota transplantation in selected neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a medical procedure that allows to establish a stable and healthy intestinal microbiota in various diseases believed to be related to a gut dysbiosis. Currently, FMT is successfully used to treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. However, in recent years there has been evidence that changes in composition of gut microbiota may also be relevant in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. This review focuses on exploring the complex connection between gut microbiota and pathogenesis of these neurological conditions. It also presents current research on a possible use of FMT as a therapeutic intervention targeting the gut-brain axis.

## 53. The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Key Mechanisms Driving Glymphopathy and Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.

The human microbiota constitute a very complex ecosystem of microorganisms inhabiting both the inside and outside of our bodies, in which health maintenance and disease modification are the main regulatory features. The recent explosion of microbiome research has begun to detail its important role in neurological health, particularly concerning cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), a disorder associated with cognitive decline and vascular dementia. This narrative review represents state-of-the-art knowledge of the intimate, complex interplay between microbiota and brain health through the gut-brain axis (GBA) and the emerging role of glymphatic system dysfunction (glymphopathy) and circulating cell-derived microparticles (MPs) as mediators of these interactions. We discuss how microbial dysbiosis promotes neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction, and impaired waste clearance in the brain, which are critical factors in the pathogenesis of CSVD. Further, we discuss lifestyle factors that shape the composition and functionality of the microbiota, focusing on sleep as a modifiable risk factor in neurological disorders. This narrative review presents recent microbiome research from a neuroscientific and vascular perspective to establish future therapeutic avenues in targeting the microbiota to improve brain health and reduce the burden of CSVD.

## 54. Probiotic treatment induces sex-dependent neuroprotection and gut microbiome shifts after traumatic brain injury.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted the potential influence of gut dysbiosis on traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes. Alterations in the abundance and diversity of Lactobacillus species may affect immune dysregulation, neuroinflammatory responses, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and neuroprotective mechanisms activated in response to TBI. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the protective and preventive effects of Pan-probiotic (PP) treatment on the inflammatory response during both the acute and chronic phases of TBI. METHODS: Males and female mice underwent controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury or sham. They received a PP mixture in drinking water containing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. reuteri, L. helveticas, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, and L. casei. In the acute group, mice received PP or vehicle (VH) treatment for 7 weeks before TBI, continuing until 3 days post-injury (dpi). In the chronic group, treatment began 2 weeks before TBI and was extended through 35 dpi. The taxonomic microbiome profiles of fecal samples were evaluated using 16S rRNA V1-V3 sequencing analysis, and Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured. Immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, and histological analyses were performed to assess neuroinflammation post-TBI, while behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate sensorimotor and cognitive functions. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that a 7-week PP administration induces specific microbial changes, including increased abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillaceae, Limosilactobacillus, and Lactiplantibacillus. PP treatment reduces lesion volume and cell death at 3 dpi, elevates SCFA levels at 35 dpi, and decreases microglial activation at both time points, particularly in males. Additionally, PP treatment improved motor recovery in males and alleviated depressive-like behaviors in females. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that PP administration modulates microbiome composition, reduces neuroinflammation, and improves motor deficits following TBI, with these effects being particularly pronounced in male mice.

## 55. Benign regulation of short-chain fatty acids: the underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects of manual acupuncture on cognitive ability and the intestinal mucosal barrier in APP/PS1 mice.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota dysbiosis is closely related to the occurrence and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The destruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier caused by a decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) plays a key role in gut microbiota dysbiosis-induced neuroinflammation in AD. Our previous research confirmed for the first time that manual acupuncture (MA) can benignly modulate gut microbiota dysbiosis, alleviating the destruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier. However, the regulatory effect of MA on SCFAs remains elusive, and the underlying mechanism by which MA improves intestinal mucosal barrier function requires elucidation. METHODS: In the APP/PS1 manual acupuncture (Am) group, MA was applied at Baihui (GV20), Yintang (GV29), and Zusanli (ST36). Probiotics were delivered to the APP/PS1 probiotic (Ap) group. Alterations in spatial learning and memory, intestinal barrier function, SCFAs in feces and serum, the expression of FFAR3 and NF-κB, and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in each group. RESULTS: Compared with those in the C57BL/6 control (Cc) group, cognitive ability was significantly decreased, SCFAs and FFAR3 expression were obviously decreased, intestinal barrier integrity was drastically impaired, and the expression of NF-κB and the levels of intestinal IL-1β and TNF-α were increased in the APP/PS1 control (Ac) group. These changes were reversed by MA and probiotics. CONCLUSION: MA can significantly reduce intestinal inflammation and alleviate destruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier in APP/PS1 mice. SCFAs/FFAR3/NF-κB may be important targets through which MA benignly regulates intestinal mucosal barrier function.

## 56. Unveiling roles of beneficial gut bacteria and optimal diets for health.

The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in human health, influencing digestion, immunity, and disease prevention. Beneficial gut bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila, Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, and Christensenella minuta contribute to metabolic regulation and immune support through bioactive metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Dietary patterns rich in prebiotics, fermented foods, and plant-based bioactive compounds, including polyphenols and flavonoids, promote microbiome diversity and stability. However, challenges such as individual variability, bioavailability, dietary adherence, and the dynamic nature of the gut microbiota remain significant. This review synthesizes current insights into gut bacteria's role in health, emphasizing the mechanisms by which dietary interventions modulate microbiota. Additionally, it highlights advancements in microbiome-targeted therapies and the transformative potential of personalized nutrition, leveraging microbiota profiling and artificial intelligence (AI) to develop tailored dietary strategies for optimizing gut health and mitigating chronic inflammatory disorders. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates scientific innovation, ethical frameworks, and practical implementation strategies.

## 57. A Novel Frontier in Gut-Brain Axis Research: The Transplantation of Fecal Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Disorders.

The gut-brain axis (GBA) represents a sophisticated bidirectional communication system connecting the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This interplay occurs primarily through neuronal, immune, and metabolic pathways. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota has been associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In recent years, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has gained attention as an innovative therapeutic approach, aiming to restore microbial balance in the gut while influencing neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways. This review explores the mechanisms by which FMT impacts the gut-brain axis. Key areas of focus include its ability to reduce neuroinflammation, strengthen gut barrier integrity, regulate neurotransmitter production, and reinstate microbial diversity. Both preclinical and clinical studies indicate that FMT can alleviate motor and cognitive deficits in PD and AD, lower neuroinflammatory markers in MS, and enhance respiratory and neuromuscular functions in ALS. Despite these findings, several challenges remain, including donor selection complexities, uncertainties about long-term safety, and inconsistencies in clinical outcomes. Innovations such as synthetic microbial communities, engineered probiotics, and AI-driven analysis of the microbiome hold the potential to improve the precision and effectiveness of FMT in managing neurodegenerative conditions. Although FMT presents considerable promise as a therapeutic development, its widespread application for neurodegenerative diseases requires thorough validation through well-designed, large-scale clinical trials. It is essential to establish standardized protocols, refine donor selection processes, and deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind its efficacy.

## 58. Effects of Short Chain Fatty Acid-Butyrate Supplementation on the Disease Severity, Inflammation, and Psychological Factors in Patients With Active Ulcerative Colitis: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.

Background: Depression and anxiety are common in UC patients due to gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased proinflammatory markers. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, participates in the regulation of gut microbiota and inflammation and has neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, we assessed the effects of sodium butyrate supplementation on the disease severity, inflammation, and psychological factors in active UC patients. Methods: This study was a randomized, parallel, double-blind controlled trial. Participants in the intervention (n = 18) and control (n = 18) groups received 600 mg/kg of sodium butyrate or rice starch as a placebo with their main meal, respectively, for 12 weeks. The partial Mayo score was used to evaluate disease severity, while the Westergren method was employed to assess the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). NLR and PLR were determined using an automated analyzer (XS-500i, Sysmex). Moreover, the psychological factors were assessed by the hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS) and the general health questionnaire (GHQ). Results: In comparison with placebo, sodium-butyrate supplementation significantly decreased the ESR level (-6.66 ± 1.56 vs. 3.00 ± 2.11, p=0.01), NLR (-0.24 ± 0.1 vs. 0.33 ± 0.23, p=0.02), Mayo score (-2.33 ± 0.41 vs. 0.22 ± 0.40, p < 0.001), HADS anxiety score (-2.77 ± 0.64 vs. 0.94 ± 0.63, p=0.001), HADS depression score (-2.38 ± 0.47 vs. 0.61 ± 0.33, p < 0.001), and GHQ total score (-12.11 ± 1.48 vs. 3.55 ± 1.39, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Butyrate could serve as an effective adjuvant treatment for reducing disease severity and alleviating psychological symptoms. This trial was registered on the Research Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, with the reference number IR.SUMS.SCHEANUT.REC.1400.037. Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials: IRCT20211214053401N1.

## 59. Gut Microbiota: A New Challenge in Mood Disorder Research.

The gut microbiome has emerged as a novel and intriguing focus in mood disorder research. Emerging evidence demonstrates the significant role of the gut microbiome in influencing mental health, suggesting a bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. This review examines the latest findings on the gut-microbiota-brain axis and elucidates how alterations in gut microbiota composition can influence this axis, leading to changes in brain function and behavior. Although dietary interventions, prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation have yielded encouraging results, significant advances are needed to establish next-generation approaches that precisely target the neurobiological mechanisms of mood disorders. Future research must focus on developing personalized treatments, facilitated by innovative therapies and technological progress, which account for individual variables such as age, sex, drug history, and lifestyle. Highlighting the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the gut microbiota, this review emphasizes the importance of integrating microbiota research into psychiatric studies to develop more effective and personalized treatment strategies for mood disorders.

## 60. Gut microbiota and their influence in brain cancer milieu. Metabolomics in Parkinson's Disease and Correlation with Disease State.

Microbial communities are not simply remnants of the past but dynamic entities that continuously evolve under the selective pressures of nature, reflecting the intricate and adaptive processes of evolution. The microbiota residing in the various regions of the human body has numerous roles in different physiological processes such as nutrition, metabolism, immune regulation, etc. In the zeal of achieving empirical insights into the ambit of the gut microbiome, the research over the years led to the revelation of reciprocal interaction between the gut microbiome and the cognitive functioning of the human body. Dysbiosis in the gut microbial composition disturbs the homeostatic cognitive functioning of the human body. This dysbiosis has been associated with various chronic diseases, including brain cancer, such as glioma, glioblastoma, etc. This review explores the mechanistic role of dysbiosis-mediated progression of brain cancers and their subtypes. Moreover, it demonstrates the regulatory role of microbial metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, such as short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, lipids, etc., in the tumour progression. Further, we also provide valuable insights into the microbiota mediating the efficiency of therapeutic regimens, thereby leveraging gut microbiota as potential biomarkers and targets for improved treatment outcomes. Changes in the level of metabolites, small molecules that are intermediates produced by metabolism or catabolism, are associated with developing diseases. Metabolite signatures in body fluids such as plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva are associated with Parkinson's disease. Here, we discuss alteration of metabolites in the TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, kynurenic network, and redox system. We also summarize the efforts of many research groups to differentiate between metabolite profiles that characterize PD motor progression and dyskinesia, gait and balance, and non-motor symptoms such as depression and cognitive decline. Understanding how changes in metabolites lead to progression in PD may allow for the identification of individuals at the earliest stage of the disease and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

## 61. Multiple Sclerosis: A Story of the Interaction Between Gut Microbiome and Components of the Immune System.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is defined as an inflammatory disorder that chronically affects the central nervous system of young people mostly and is distributed globally. It is associated with degeneration and demyelination of the myelin sheath around the nerves, resulting in multiple neurological disability symptoms ranging from mild to severe cases that end with paralysis sometimes. MS is one of the rising diseases globally that is unfortunately associated with reduced quality of life and adding national economic burdens. The definite MS mechanism is not clearly defined; however, all the previous researches confirm the role of the immune system as the master contributor in the pathogenesis. Innate and adaptive immune cells are activated peripherally then attracted toward the central nervous system (CNS) due to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Recently, the gut-brain axis was shown to depend on gut metabolites that are produced by different microorganisms in the colon. The difference in microbiota composition between individuals is responsible for diversity in secreted metabolites that affect immune responses locally in the gut or systemically when reach blood circulation to the brain. It may enhance or suppress immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS) (repeated short forms); consequently, it may exacerbate or ameliorate MS symptoms. Recent data showed that some metabolites can be used as adjuvant therapy in MS and other inflammatory diseases. This review sheds light on the nature of MS and the possible interaction between gut microbiota and immune system regulation through the gut-brain axis, hence contributing to MS pathogenesis.

## 62. Interplay of Neuroinflammation and Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis in Alzheimer's Disease Using Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Biomarker in 3 × Tg-AD Mouse Models.

The relationship between alterations in brain microstructure and dysbiosis of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has garnered increasing attention, although the functional implications of these changes are not yet fully elucidated. This research examines how neuroinflammation, systemic inflammation, and gut microbiota interact in male 3 × Tg-AD and B6129SF1/J wild-type (WT) mice at 6 months-old (6-MO) and 12 months-old (12-MO). Employing a combination of behavioral assessments, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), microbiota profiling, cytokine analysis, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and immunohistochemistry, we explored the progression of AD-related pathology. Significant memory impairments in AD mice at both assessed ages were correlated with altered DKI parameters that suggest neuroinflammation and microstructural damage. We observed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and IFN-γ, in the serum, which were associated with increased activity of microglia and astrocytes in brain regions critical for memory. Although gut microbiota analysis did not reveal significant changes in alpha diversity, it did show notable differences in beta diversity and a diminished Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio in AD mice at 12-MO. Furthermore, a reduction in six kinds of SCFAs were identified at two time points of 6-MO and 12-MO, indicating widespread disruption in gut microbial metabolism. These findings underscore a complex bidirectional relationship between systemic inflammation and gut dysbiosis in AD, highlighting the gut-brain axis as a crucial factor in disease progression. This study emphasizes the potential of integrating DKI metrics, microbiota profiling, and SCFA analysis to enhance our understanding of AD pathology and to identify new therapeutic targets.

## 63. Multi-level analysis of gut microbiome extracellular vesicles-host interaction reveals a connection to gut-brain axis signaling.

Microbiota-released extracellular vesicles (MEVs) have emerged as a key player in intercellular signaling. However, their involvement in the gut-brain axis has been poorly investigated. We hypothesize that MEVs cross host cellular barriers and deliver their cargoes of bioactive compounds to the brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the cargo capacity of MEVs for bioactive metabolites and their interactions with the host cellular barriers. First, we conducted a multi-omics profiling of MEVs' contents from ex vivo and stool samples. Metabolomics analysis identified various neuro-related compounds encapsulated within MEVs, such as arachidonyl-dopamine, gabapentin, glutamate, and N-acylethanolamines. Metaproteomics unveiled an enrichment of enzymes involved in neuronal metabolism, primarily in the glutamine/glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathway. These neuro-related proteins and metabolites were correlated with Bacteroides spp. We isolated 18 Bacteroides strains and assessed their GABA production capacity in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and culture supernatant. A GABA-producing Bacteroides finegoldii, released EVs with a high GABA content (4 µM) compared to Phocaeicola massiliensis. Upon testing the capacity of MEVs to cross host barriers, MEVs exhibited a dose-dependent paracellular transport and were endocytosed by Caco-2 and hCMEC/D3 cells. Exposure of Caco-2 cells to MEVs did not alter expression of genes related to intestinal barrier integrity, while affected immune pathways and cell apoptosis process as revealed by RNA-seq analyses. In vivo, MEVs biodistributed across mice organs, including the brain, liver, stomach, and spleen. Our results highlight the ability of MEVs to cross the intestinal and blood-brain barriers to deliver their cargoes to distant organs, with potential implication for the gut-brain axis. IMPORTANCE: Microbiota-released extracellular vesicles (MEVs) have emerged as a key player in intercellular signaling. In this study, a multi-level analysis revealed presence of a diverse array of biologically active molecules encapsulated within MEVs, including neuroactive metabolites, such as arachidonyl-dopamine, gabapentin, glutamate, and N-acylethanolamines, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Metaproteomics also unveiled an enrichment of neural-related proteins, mainly the glutamine/glutamate/GABA pathway. MEVs were able to cross epithelial and blood-brain barriers in vitro. RNA-seq analyses showed that MEVs stimulate several immune pathways while suppressing cell apoptosis process. Furthermore, MEVs were able to traverse the intestinal barriers and reach distal organs, including the brain, thereby potentially influencing brain functionality and contributing to mental and behavior.

## 64. Chronic inflammation in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 modulates gut microbiome: a review of literature on COVID-19 sequelae and gut dysbiosis.

BACKGROUND: Long COVID or Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 is an emerging syndrome, recognized in COVID-19 patients who suffer from mild to severe illness and do not recover completely. Most studies define Long COVID, through symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, and headache prevailing four or more weeks post-initial infection. Global variations in Long COVID presentation and symptoms make it challenging to standardize features of Long COVID. Long COVID appears to be accompanied by an auto-immune multi-faceted syndrome where the virus or viral antigen persistence causes continuous stimulation of the immune response, resulting in multi-organ immune dysregulation. MAIN TEXT: This review is focused on understanding the risk factors of Long COVID with a special emphasis on the dysregulation of the gut-brain axis. Two proposed mechanisms are discussed here. The first mechanism is related to the dysfunction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 infection, leading to impaired mTOR pathway activation, reduced AMP secretion, and causing dysbiotic changes in the gut. Secondly, gut-brain axis dysregulation accompanied by decreased production of short-chain fatty acids, impaired enteroendocrine cell function, and increased leakiness of the gut, which favors translocation of pathogens or lipopolysaccharide in circulation causing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The altered Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis is accompanied by the reduced level of neurotransmitter, and decreased stimulation of the vagus nerve, which may cause neuroinflammation and dysregulation of serum cortisol levels. The dysbiotic microbiome in Long COVID patients is characterized by a decrease in beneficial short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Dorea, and Bifidobacterium) and an increase in opportunistic bacteria (Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Enterococcus). This dysbiosis is transient and may be impacted by interventions including probiotics, and dietary supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are required to understand the geographic variation, racial and ethnic differences in phenotypes of Long COVID, the influence of viral strains on existing and emerging phenotypes, to explore long-term effects of gut dysbiosis, and gut-brain axis dysregulation, as well as the potential role of diet and probiotics in alleviating those symptoms.

## 65. The Neonatal Microbiome: Implications for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Other Neurodegenerations.

Most brain development occurs in the "first 1000 days", a critical period from conception to a child's second birthday. Critical brain processes that occur during this time include synaptogenesis, myelination, neural pruning, and the formation of functioning neuronal circuits. Perturbations during the first 1000 days likely contribute to later-life neurodegenerative disease, including sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neurodevelopment is determined by many events, including the maturation and colonization of the infant microbiome and its metabolites, specifically neurotransmitters, immune modulators, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids. Successful microbiome maturation and gut-brain axis function depend on maternal factors (stress and exposure to toxins during pregnancy), mode of delivery, quality of the postnatal environment, diet after weaning from breast milk, and nutritional deficiencies. While the neonatal microbiome is highly plastic, it remains prone to dysbiosis which, once established, may persist into adulthood, thereby inducing the development of chronic inflammation and abnormal excitatory/inhibitory balance, resulting in neural excitation. Both are recognized as key pathophysiological processes in the development of ALS.

## 66. Exploring the Gut Microbiota-Retina Axis: Implications for Health and Disease.

The gut microbiota represents a rich and adaptive microbial network inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract, performing key functions in nutrient processing, immune response modulation, intestinal wall protection, and microbial defense. Its composition remains highly personalized and responsive to external influences, including lifestyle patterns, physical activity, body composition, and nutritional intake. The interactions of the gut microbiota with bodily systems are conventionally interpreted as broad systemic impacts on organ balance. Yet, emerging research-exemplified by the gut microbiota-brain axis-suggests the potential existence of more targeted and direct communication mechanisms. Dysbiosis, characterized by microbial ecosystem disturbance, generates multiple metabolic compounds capable of entering systemic circulation and reaching distant tissues, notably including ocular structures. This microbial imbalance has been associated with both systemic and localized conditions linked to eye disorders. Accumulating scientific evidence now supports the concept of a gut-retina axis, underscoring the significant role of microbiota disruption in generating various retinal pathologies. This review comprehensively investigates gut microbiota composition, functional dynamics, and dysbiosis-induced alterations, with specific focus on retinal interactions in age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and retinal artery occlusion. Moreover, the review explores microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies, including precision nutritional interventions and microbial transplantation, as potential modulators of retinal disease progression.

## 67. Multiple pathways through which the gut microbiota regulates neuronal mitochondria constitute another possible direction for depression.

As a significant mental health disorder worldwide, the treatment of depression has long faced the challenges of a low treatment rate, significant drug side effects and a high relapse rate. Recent studies have revealed that the gut microbiota and neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction play central roles in the pathogenesis of depression: the gut microbiota influences the course of depression through multiple pathways, including immune regulation, HPA axis modulation and neurotransmitter metabolism. Mitochondrial function serves as a key hub that mediates mood disorders through mechanisms such as defective energy metabolism, impaired neuroplasticity and amplified neuroinflammation. Notably, a bidirectional regulatory network exists between the gut microbiota and mitochondria: the flora metabolite butyrate enhances mitochondrial biosynthesis through activation of the AMPK-PGC1α pathway, whereas reactive oxygen species produced by mitochondria counteract the flora composition by altering the intestinal epithelial microenvironment. In this study, we systematically revealed the potential pathways by which the gut microbiota improves neuronal mitochondrial function by regulating neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial autophagy, and oxidative stress homeostasis and proposed the integration of probiotic supplementation, dietary fiber intervention, and fecal microbial transplantation to remodel the flora-mitochondrial axis, which provides a theoretical basis for the development of novel antidepressant therapies targeting gut-brain interactions.

## 68. Alterations in fecal microbiota composition and cytokine expression profiles in adolescents with depression: a case-control study.

Emerging evidence has highlighted that altered gut microbiota are associated with the onset and progression of depression via regulating the gut-brain axis. However, existing research has predominantly focused on children and adults, frequently neglecting adolescent depression. Given the rising prevalence and substantial impact of adolescent depression on functional impairment and suicidality, it is essential to focus more on this age group. In this study, we examined the fecal microbiota and inflammatory profiles of 99 depressed adolescents and 106 age-matched healthy controls using Illumina NovaSeq sequencing and multiplex immunoassays, respectively. Our findings revealed lower bacterial α-diversity and richness, alongside altered β-diversity in adolescents with depression. Gut dysbiosis associated with adolescent depression was characterized by increased pro-inflammatory genera such as Streptococcus and decreased anti-inflammatory genera like Faecalibacterium. These differential genera may serve as potential non-invasive biomarkers for adolescent depression, either individually or in combination. We also observed disruptions in the inferred microbiota functions in adolescent depression-associated microbiota, particularly in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Additionally, depressed adolescents exhibited systemic immune dysfunction, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which showed significant correlations with the differential genera. Our study bridges the gap between children and adults by providing new insights into the fecal microbiota characteristics and their links to immune system disruptions in depressed adolescents, which offer new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in this age group.

## 69. The Inflammatory Mechanism of Parkinson's Disease: Gut Microbiota Metabolites Affect the Development of the Disease Through the Gut-Brain Axis.

Parkinson's disease is recognized as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, with its incidence rate projected to increase alongside ongoing population growth. However, the precise etiology of Parkinson's disease remains elusive. This article explores the inflammatory mechanisms linking gut microbiota to Parkinson's disease, emphasizing alterations in gut microbiota and their metabolites that influence the disease's progression through the bidirectional transmission of inflammatory signals along the gut-brain axis. Building on this mechanistic framework, this article further discusses research methodologies and treatment strategies focused on gut microbiota metabolites, including metabolomics detection techniques, animal model investigations, and therapeutic approaches such as dietary interventions, probiotic treatments, and fecal transplantation. Ultimately, this article aims to elucidate the relationship between gut microbiota metabolites and the inflammatory mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease, thereby paving the way for novel avenues in the research and treatment of this condition.

## 70. Acetate and propionate vs. iTBS as a novel method for cognitive dysfunction and anxiety symptoms in delayed encephalopathy after acute carbon monoxide poisoning rat.

BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment methods for delayed encephalopathy after acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning (DEACMP) were not identified. Thus, this study was conducted to compare the efficacies of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in treating cognitive dysfunction and anxiety symptoms of DEACMP rat. METHODS: In phase I, a DEACMP rat model was built to assess the inflammation levels in the hippocampus and levels of SCFAs in the serum of DEACMP rats. In phase II, DEACMP rats were randomly assigned into four groups: DEACMP + placebo, DEACMP + SCFAs, DEACMP + sham iTBS, and DEACMP + iTBS. The intervention was continued for 2 weeks. A Morris water maze and open field tests were used to assess cognitive function and anxiety symptoms, respectively. RESULTS: The levels of three inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and two SCFAs (acetate and propionate) were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in DEACMP rats. After treatment, cognitive dysfunction and anxiety symptoms were significantly improved in the DEACMP + iTBS group and the DEACMP + SCFAs (consisting of acetate and propionate) group. Both SCFAs and iTBS could significantly improve the increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the hippocampus, and SCFAs could also improve the decreased levels of GPR41, GPR43, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the hippocampus of DEACMP rats. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that both iTBS and SCFA solutions consisting of acetate and propionate produced good effects on DEACMP rats by regulating inflammation levels in the hippocampus, and acetate/propionate-GPR41/GPR43-IL-1β/IL-6/TNF-α-dopamine/norepinephrine may be a potential pathway in SCFAs for the treatment of DEACMP.

## 71. Association of gut microbiota and immunometabolic profiles with ischemic stroke severity.

This study investigates the influence of three regulators of human homeostasis-intestinal microbiota, immune profile, and circulating metabolites-on stroke severity. We conducted a study involving 33 patients with mild/moderate stroke (MS) and 32 with severe stroke (SS), all assessed during the acute phase (first 24 h). The analysis focused on microbiota composition (45 patients), serum metabolomics and inflammatory markers (20 patients). The patients with SS exhibited more pronounced insulin resistance associated with increased levels of branched-chain amino acids and their metabolites. SS patients showed an increase in inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, and surprisingly an increase in IL-10 and butyrate which are anti-inflammatory. SS patients also displayed a distinct microbiota profile, with statistically significant differences in β-diversity compared to the MS group, notably a higher prevalence of Pseudomonadota (formerly Proteobacteria). In summary, our data indicate that patients with SS, compared to those with MS, are characterized by a more inflammatory and insulin-resistant state, associated with three key regulators: microbiota, metabolites, and interleukins. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory components of the gut-brain axis, which could be developed into cost-effective and widely accessible therapies for SS.

## 72. Gut-brain axis in post-traumatic stress disorder: microbial - mediated mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches - A narrative review.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe mental disorder that occurs after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Not only does this disorder severely impair the quality of life and emotional wellbeing of patients, but in recent years the global rate of PTSD diagnoses has increased to 1.5-2 times, and the prevalence of PTSD associated with COVID-19 events in particular has surged to 10%-25%, underscoring the urgency of developing effective treatments. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general population is estimated to be approximately 3.9%, while in high-risk populations, such as war veterans, it can be as high as 30%. As a key pathway connecting the central nervous system to peripheral organs, the gut-brain axis has received increasing attention for its role in PTSD. Although the gut-brain axis has been shown to be associated with several psychiatric disorders, especially depression, its specific role in PTSD remains undercharacterized. Existing studies suggest that specific strains of Lactobacillus (e.g., Lactobacillus reuteri) may alleviate inflammatory responses and improve PTSD-like behaviors by down-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α). In this study, we used a narrative review approach to sort out the research progress of gut microbiota alteration in PTSD, and compared the characteristics of changes in specific microbial taxa (e.g., Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, etc.), the index of microbiota diversity (α/β diversity), and the levels of inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) between the animal model and the human patients, respectively, in order to We further explored the potential pathogenic mechanisms mediated by microorganisms, such as influencing the vagal pathway, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, immune system and other processes involved in the pathology of PTSD, and summarized the intervention strategies targeting gut microecology, such as probiotic supplementation, dietary interventions and fecal bacteria transplantation.

## 73. The Role of Probiotics in Modulating the Gut Microbiome in Alzheimer's Disease: A Review.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged as a global public health priority characterized by escalating prevalence and the limited efficacy of current therapeutic approaches. Although the pathological complexity of AD is well-recognized, its underlying etiology remains incompletely elucidated. Current research highlights a bidirectional gut-brain axis (GBA) interaction, wherein gut microbiome perturbations may impair intestinal barrier stability, influence immune responses, and blood-brain barrier permeability through microbial metabolite-mediated pathways, thereby contributing to AD pathophysiology. Notably, probiotics demonstrate therapeutic potential by restoring gut microbiome homeostasis, reinforcing intestinal barrier integrity, and mitigating neuroinflammatory responses via GBA. This review focuses on investigating the gut microbiome alterations in AD pathogenesis, the interaction of probiotics with GBA, and its significance in AD pathogenesis. By synthesizing current clinical evidence, this review aims to establish a scientific foundation for probiotic-based interventions as a novel therapeutic strategy in AD management.

## 74. Shattering the Amyloid Illusion: The Microbial Enigma of Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis-From Gut Microbiota and Viruses to Brain Biofilms.

For decades, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research has focused on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which identifies amyloid-beta (Aβ) as the primary driver of the disease. However, the consistent failure of Aβ-targeted therapies to demonstrate efficacy, coupled with significant safety concerns, underscores the need to rethink our approach to AD treatment. Emerging evidence points to microbial infections as environmental factors in AD pathoetiology. Although a definitive causal link remains unestablished, the collective evidence is compelling. This review explores unconventional perspectives and emerging paradigms regarding microbial involvement in AD pathogenesis, emphasizing the gut-brain axis, brain biofilms, the oral microbiome, and viral infections. Transgenic mouse models show that gut microbiota dysregulation precedes brain Aβ accumulation, emphasizing gut-brain signaling pathways. Viral infections like Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to AD by modulating host processes like the immune system. Aβ peptide's antimicrobial function as a response to microbial infection might inadvertently promote AD. We discuss potential microbiome-based therapies as promising strategies for managing and potentially preventing AD progression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores gut microbial balance, reduces Aβ accumulation, and improves cognition in preclinical models. Probiotics and prebiotics reduce neuroinflammation and Aβ plaques, while antiviral therapies targeting HSV-1 and vaccines like the shingles vaccine show potential to mitigate AD pathology. Developing effective treatments requires standardized methods to identify and measure microbial infections in AD patients, enabling personalized therapies that address individual microbial contributions to AD pathogenesis. Further research is needed to clarify the interactions between microbes and Aβ, explore bacterial and viral interplay, and understand their broader effects on host processes to translate these insights into clinical interventions.

## 75. Gut Microbiome, Neuroinflammation, and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: Insights from Rodent Models.

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a significant public health issue that affects children. It results from ethanol exposure during pregnancy, leading to considerable physical, neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and cognitive deficits. The exact mechanism is not well understood. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the influence of gut microbiome on brain development through the gut-brain axis. Changes in the gut microbiome resulting from ethanol exposure may contribute to the pathology of FASD, potentially involving neuroinflammation. This literature review summarizes the existing research and primary animal studies on the impact of early ethanol exposure on the gut microbiome, neuroinflammation, brain development, and behavioral consequences. The evidence suggests that early ethanol exposure alters the gut microbiome, which may induce neuroinflammation, brain damage, and cognitive impairment. However, a clear causal relationship among these factors remains to be fully elucidated.

## 76. Post-stroke depression: exploring gut microbiota-mediated barrier dysfunction through immune regulation.

Post-stroke depression (PSD) is one of the most common and devastating neuropsychiatric complications in stroke patients, affecting more than one-third of survivors of ischemic stroke (IS). Despite its high incidence, PSD is often overlooked or undertreated in clinical practice, and effective preventive measures and therapeutic interventions remain limited. Although the exact mechanisms of PSD are not fully understood, emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a key role in regulating gut-brain communication. This has sparked great interest in the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) and PSD, especially in the context of cerebral ischemia. In addition to the gut microbiota, another important factor is the gut barrier, which acts as a frontline sensor distinguishing between beneficial and harmful microbes, regulating inflammatory responses and immunomodulation. Based on this, this paper proposes a new approach, the microbiota-immune-barrier axis, which is not only closely related to the pathophysiology of IS but may also play a critical role in the occurrence and progression of PSD. This review aims to systematically analyze how the gut microbiota affects the integrity and function of the barrier after IS through inflammatory responses and immunomodulation, leading to the production or exacerbation of depressive symptoms in the context of cerebral ischemia. In addition, we will explore existing technologies that can assess the MGBA and potential therapeutic strategies for PSD, with the hope of providing new insights for future research and clinical interventions.

## 77. Fermented Dairy Products as Precision Modulators of Gut Microbiota and Host Health: Mechanistic Insights, Clinical Evidence, and Future Directions.

Dairy products-encompassing yogurt, kefir, cheese, and cultured milk beverages-are emerging as versatile, food-based modulators of gut microbiota and host physiology. This review synthesizes mechanistic insights demonstrating how live starter cultures and their fermentation-derived metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, bioactive peptides, and exopolysaccharides) act synergistically to enhance microbial diversity, reinforce epithelial barrier integrity via upregulation of tight-junction proteins, and modulate immune signaling. Clinical evidence supports significant improvements in metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, lipid profiles, blood pressure) and reductions in systemic inflammation across metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and IBS cohorts. We highlight critical modulatory factors-including strain specificity, host enterotypes and FUT2 genotype, fermentation parameters, and matrix composition-that govern probiotic engraftment, postbiotic yield, and therapeutic efficacy. Despite promising short-term outcomes, current studies are limited by heterogeneous designs and brief intervention periods, underscoring the need for long-term, adaptive trials and integrative multi-omics to establish durability and causality. Looking forward, precision nutrition frameworks that harness baseline microbiota profiling, host genetics, and data-driven fermentation design will enable bespoke fermented dairy formulations, transforming these traditional foods into next-generation functional matrices for targeted prevention and management of metabolic, inflammatory, and neuroimmune disorders.

## 78. Unlocking the gut-liver axis: microbial contributions to the pathogenesis of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by hepatic lipid accumulation and subsequent inflammation. This condition is closely linked to metabolic syndrome and obesity, with its prevalence rising due to sedentary lifestyles and high-calorie diets. The pathogenesis of MAFLD involves multiple factors, including insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in MAFLD development, with dysbiosis contributing to liver inflammation through various mechanisms, such as enhanced intestinal permeability and the translocation of bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids, influence hepatic function and immune responses, with potential implications for disease progression. Specific gut microbiome signatures have been identified in MAFLD patients, offering potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Moreover, gut-derived toxins, such as endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides, trimethylamine-N-oxide and bacterial metabolites, significantly influence liver damage and inflammation, highlighting the complex interplay between the gut microbiome and hepatic health. This review comprehensively examines the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and MAFLD, focusing on underlying pathogenic mechanisms, potential biomarkers, and emerging microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies for disease management.

## 79. Exploring the role of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease: insights from fecal microbiota transplantation.

As a common neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) is typified by α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation and progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Clinical manifestations encompass motor symptoms and non-motor aspects that severely impair quality of life. Existing treatments mainly address symptoms, with no effective disease-modifying therapies available. The gut microbiota refers to the community of microorganisms that colonize the intestinal tract. The gut microbiota, gut, and brain are all connected via a complicated, mutual communication pathway known as the "gut microbiota-gut-brain axis." Gut microbiota dysbiosis is strongly linked to the onset and course of PD, according to growing data. In individuals with PD, gut dysbiosis correlates with clinical phenotype, disease duration, severity, and progression rates. Mechanistically, gut dysbiosis contributes to PD through enhanced intestinal permeability, increased intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, abnormal α-syn aggregation, oxidative stress, and reduced neurotransmitter synthesis. Therefore, focusing on the gut microbiota is regarded as a potentially effective treatment strategy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emerging approach to modulate gut microbiota, with the goal of recovering microbiota diversity and function by transferring functional intestinal flora from healthy individuals into patients' gastrointestinal tracts. FMT is expected to become a promising therapy of PD and has a broad research and application prospect. Evidence suggests that FMT may restore gut microbiota, ease clinical symptoms, and provide potential neuroprotective benefits. However, the precise therapeutic mechanisms of FMT in PD remain uncertain, necessitating further research to clarify its effectiveness. This review examines alterations in gut microbiota linked to PD, mechanisms through which gut dysbiosis influences the disease, and the latest advancements in FMT research for treating PD, setting the stage for its clinical application.

## 80. The role of nutrition and gut microbiome in childhood brain development and behavior.

The intricate relationship between nutrition, the gut microbiome, and brain development has garnered significant attention in recent years, concerning its implications for child behavior and cognitive function. The gut-brain axis mediates this relationship through microbial modulation of inflammation, neuroactive compounds, and blood-brain barrier integrity, particularly during prenatal and early postnatal periods. Healthy dietary patterns such as whole foods, high-fiber foods, and minimally processed foods play a crucial role in shaping the gut microbiota, promoting microbial diversity and overall gut health. As a result, a balanced and diverse microbiome supports healthy brain function and development. Furthermore, disruptions in gut microbiota composition have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders in children, including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety. By integrating findings from animal models, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies, this review summarizes current advances on how early-life nutrition and gut microbiota interaction influence brain development and childhood behaviors. Ultimately, this paper underscores the potential for dietary interventions to promote optimal neurodevelopmental health and address behavioral issues in children.

## 81. Review: Gut Microbiota-A Powerful Tool for Improving Pig Welfare by Influencing Behavior Through the Gut-Brain Axis.

Animal welfare is one of the core concerns in the field of animal science, with behavior serving as a direct reflection of emotional state and health, and thus a key indicator for welfare assessment. With the widespread adoption of intensive farming systems, abnormal behaviors in pigs have become a prominent marker of compromised welfare. In the past few years, the role of gut microbes in the regulation of animal behavior has received increasing attention. This review summarizes the strong relationship between pig behavior and welfare, and focuses on the emerging research linking gut microbiota to behavioral expression in pigs. Furthermore, it outlines the mechanisms by which the microbiota modulates behavior through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), including immune, endocrine, and neural pathways. Additionally, the potential of microbiota-targeted interventions to improve pig welfare, including probiotics and prebiotics, will be evaluated. As a critical bridge connecting physiology and psychology, the gut microbiota shows significant promise for advancing welfare regulation in pigs.

## 82. The Role of the Gastrointestinal Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons leading to debilitating motor and non-motor symptoms. Beyond its well-known neurological features, emerging evidence underscores the pivotal role of the gut-brain axis and gastrointestinal microbiota in PD pathogenesis. Dysbiosis has been strongly linked to PD and is associated with increased intestinal permeability, chronic inflammation, and the production of neurotoxic metabolites that may exacerbate neuronal damage. METHODS: This review delves into the complex interplay between PD and dysbiosis, shedding light on two peculiar subsets of dysbiosis, Helicobacter pylori infection and small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth. These conditions may not only contribute to PD progression but also influence therapeutic responses such as L-dopa efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The potential to modulate gut microbiota through probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics; fecal microbiota transplantation; and antibiotics represents a promising frontier for innovative PD treatments. Despite this potential, the current evidence is limited by small sample sizes and methodological variability across studies. Rigorous, large-scale, randomized placebo-controlled trials with standardized treatments in terms of composition, dosage, and duration are urgently needed to validate these findings and pave the way for microbiota-based therapeutic strategies in PD management.

## 83. Role of Antioxidants in Modulating the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Their Impact on Neurodegenerative Diseases.

This narrative review presents the role of antioxidants in regulating the gut microbiota and the impact on the gut-brain axis, with a particular focus on neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These diseases are characterised by cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, all of which are significantly exacerbated by oxidative stress. This review elucidates the contribution of oxidative damage to disease progression and explores the potential of antioxidants to mitigate these pathological processes through modulation of the gut microbiota and associated pathways. Based on recent studies retrieved from reputable databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, this article outlines the mechanisms by which antioxidants influence gut health and exert neuroprotective effects. Specifically, it discusses how antioxidants, including polyphenols, vitamins, and flavonoids, contribute to the reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and neuroinflammation, thereby promoting neuronal survival and minimising oxidative damage in the brain. In addition, the article explores the role of antioxidants in modulating key molecular pathways involved in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, such as the NF-κB, Nrf2, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways, which regulate ROS generation, inflammatory cytokine expression, and antioxidant responses essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis in both the gut and the central nervous system. In addition, this review explores the complex relationship between gut-derived metabolites, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting how dysbiosis-an imbalance in the gut microbiota-can exacerbate oxidative stress and contribute to neuroinflammation, thereby accelerating the progression of such diseases as AD and PD. The review also examines the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by beneficial gut bacteria in modulating these pathways to attenuate neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. Furthermore, the article explores the therapeutic potential of microbiota-targeted interventions, including antioxidant delivery by probiotics and prebiotics, as innovative strategies to restore microbial homeostasis and support brain health. By synthesising current knowledge on the interplay between antioxidants, the gut-brain axis, and the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, this review highlights the therapeutic promise of antioxidant-based interventions in mitigating oxidative stress and neurodegenerative disease progression. It also highlights the need for further research into antioxidant-rich dietary strategies and microbiota-focused therapies as promising avenues for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

## 84. BGMDB: A curated database linking gut microbiota dysbiosis to brain disorders.

The gut microbiota is a fundamental component of human health and has been increasingly implicated in the etiology of neurological disorders. Neurotransmitters, acting as key mediators of gut-brain communication, are closely associated with both the progression and therapeutic modulation of brain diseases. Despite significant advancements in microbiome research, the complex interplay between gut microbiota and neurological disorders remains poorly understood, and a comprehensive resource integrating these associations is lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed the Brain Disease Gut Microbiota Database (BGMDB), a rigorously curated repository documenting experimentally validated relationships between gut microbiota and brain diseases. BGMDB encompasses 1419 associations involving 609 gut microbiota taxa and 43 brain disorders, along with 184 tripartite interactions linking brain diseases, neurotransmitters, and microbiota across six neurotransmitter systems. Additionally, BGMDB integrates genetic data from the gutMGene database, allowing users to explore microbiota-mediated genetic associations with brain disease pathology and neuroanatomical alterations. A user-friendly interface enables researchers to navigate relevant information through graphical query tools, comprehensive browsing functionalities, and data retrieval options. Our BGMDB provides an unparalleled resource for advancing mechanistic insights into gut-brain interactions, facilitating novel microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. BGMDB is freely available at: http://bgmdb.online/bgmdb.

## 85. The Obesity-Epigenetics-Microbiome Axis: Strategies for Therapeutic Intervention.

Obesity (OB) has become a serious health issue owing to its ever-increasing prevalence over the past few decades due to its contribution to severe metabolic and inflammatory disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. The unbalanced energy metabolism in OB is associated with substantial epigenetic changes mediated by the gut microbiome (GM) structure and composition alterations. Remarkably, experimental evidence also indicates that OB-induced epigenetic modifications in adipocytes can lead to cellular "memory" alterations, predisposing individuals to weight regain after caloric restriction and subsequently inducing inflammatory pathways in the liver. Various environmental factors, especially diet, play key roles in the progression or prevention of OB and OB-related disorders by modulating the GM structure and composition and affecting epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we will first focus on the key role of epigenetic aberrations in the development of OB. Then, we discuss the association between abnormal alterations in the composition of the microbiome and OB and the interplays between the microbiome and the epigenome in the development of OB. Finally, we review promising strategies, including prebiotics, probiotics, a methyl-rich diet, polyphenols, and herbal foods for the prevention and/or treatment of OB via modulating the GM and their metabolites influencing the epigenome.

## 86. Role of gut-brain axis dysregulation in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: mechanisms and therapeutic implications.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a global health challenge due to its rising prevalence and strong association with metabolic syndrome. Recent studies highlight the critical role of the gut-brain axis (GBA)-a bidirectional communication system between the gut, brain, and liver-in NAFLD pathogenesis. Dysregulation of this axis can worsen metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and liver injury. This review discusses the mechanisms driving GBA dysregulation in NAFLD, including alterations in gut microbiota, increased intestinal permeability, neuroinflammation, and imbalances in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). We also explore therapeutic strategies, such as microbiota modulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and neuroprotective interventions, that may help mitigate the effects of GBA dysfunction on NAFLD progression.

## 87. Therapeutic targeting of obesity-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Excessive fat storage in obesity promotes the progressive infiltration of immune cells into adipose tissue, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as cytokines and adipokines. These inflammatory mediators circulate through the bloodstream, propagating inflammation both in the periphery and in the central nervous system. Gut dysbiosis, which results in a leaky intestinal barrier, exacerbates inflammation and plays a significant role in linking obesity to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration through the gut-brain/gut-brain-liver axis. Inflammatory states within the brain can lead to insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, autolysosomal dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress. These disruptions impair normal neuronal function and subsequently lead to cognitive decline and motor deficits, similar to the pathologies observed in major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Understanding the underlying disease mechanisms is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to address defects in these inflammatory and metabolic pathways. In this review, we summarize and provide insights into different therapeutic strategies, including methods to alter gut dysbiosis, lifestyle changes, dietary supplementation, as well as pharmacological agents derived from natural sources, that target obesity-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

## 88. Microbiome Engineering for Biotherapeutic in Alzheimer's Disease Through the Gut-Brain Axis: Potentials and Limitations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by considerable cognitive decline and functional impairment, primarily due to the progressive alteration of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Pathological manifestations of AD include the loss of synaptic plasticity, reduction in synaptic strength by amyloid-beta, aggregation, and neurotoxicity from tau protein post-translational modifications, all contributing to the disruption of neural networks. Despite its current pharmacological treatment for AD, different approaches to treat such disease are being developed, from a microbiome perspective. The microbiome encompasses a diverse microorganism, including beneficial bacteria that create a positive impact to diminish AD pathogenesis. Growing evidence suggests that probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic, and postbiotics can positively modulate the gut-brain axis, reducing systemic inflammation, restoring neurotransmitter balance, and improving gut health, thereby possibly mitigating AD pathogenesis. Moreover, there is paraprobiotics as the most recently developed biotherapeutic with beneficial effects. This review explores the correlation between AD and gut-brain axis as a novel biotherapeutic target. The underlying mechanism of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD is examined. Novel insights into the current applications as potential treatment and its limitations are highlighted.

## 89. Advancements in the investigation of gut microbiota-based strategies for stroke prevention and treatment.

Stroke represents a predominant cause of mortality and disability on a global scale, impacting millions annually and exerting a considerable strain on healthcare systems. The incidence of stroke exhibits regional variability, with ischemic stroke accounting for the majority of occurrences. Post-stroke complications, such as cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, and recurrent stroke, profoundly affect patients' quality of life. Recent advancements have elucidated the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), underscoring the complex interplay between gut health and brain function. Dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance in gut microbiota, is significantly linked to an elevated risk of stroke and unfavorable outcomes. The MGBA plays a crucial role in modulating immune function, neurotransmitter levels, and metabolic byproducts, which may intensify neuroinflammation and impair cerebral health. This review elucidates the role of MGBA in stroke pathophysiology and explores potential gut-targeted therapeutic strategies to reduce stroke risk and promote recovery, including probiotics, prebiotics, pharmacological interventions, and dietary modifications. However, the current prevention and treatment strategies based on intestinal flora still face many problems, such as the large difference of individual intestinal flora, the stability of efficacy, and the long-term safety need to be considered. Further research needs to be strengthened to promote its better application in clinical practice.

## 90. Recent Advances in Gut Microbiota in Psoriatic Arthritis.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint inflammation and skin lesions. Recent research has underscored the critical role of gut microbiota-comprising bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea-in the pathogenesis and progression of PsA. This narrative review synthesizes the latest findings on the influence of gut microbiota on PsA, focusing on mechanisms such as immune modulation, microbial dysbiosis, the gut-joint axis, and its impact on treatment. Advances in high-throughput sequencing and metagenomics have revealed distinct microbial profiles associated with PsA. Studies show that individuals with PsA have a unique gut microbiota composition, differing significantly from healthy controls. Alterations in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa, including a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in potentially pathogenic microbes, contribute to systemic inflammation by affecting the intestinal barrier and promoting immune responses. This review explores the impact of various factors on gut microbiota composition, including age, hygiene, comorbidities, and medication use. Additionally, it highlights the role of diet, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as promising strategies to modulate gut microbiota and alleviate PsA symptoms. The gut-skin-joint axis concept illustrates how gut microbiota influences not only gastrointestinal health but also skin and joint inflammation. Understanding the complex interplay between gut microbiota and PsA could lead to novel, microbiome-based therapeutic approaches. These insights offer hope for improved patient outcomes through targeted manipulation of the gut microbiota, enhancing both diagnosis and treatment strategies for PsA.

## 91. Exploring the microbiota-gut-brain axis: impact on brain structure and function.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) plays a significant role in the maintenance of brain structure and function. The MGBA serves as a conduit between the CNS and the ENS, facilitating communication between the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain via diverse pathways. In the initial stages of this review, we will examine the way how MGBA affects neurogenesis, neuronal dendritic morphology, axonal myelination, microglia structure, brain blood barrier (BBB) structure and permeability, and synaptic structure. Furthermore, we will review the potential mechanistic pathways of neuroplasticity through MGBA influence. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a pivotal role in the MGBA, where they can modify the BBB. We will therefore discuss how SCFAs can influence microglia, neuronal, and astrocyte function, as well as their role in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Subsequently, we will examine the technical strategies employed to study MGBA interactions, including using germ-free (GF) animals, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and antibiotics-induced dysbiosis. Finally, we will examine how particular bacterial strains can affect brain structure and function. By gaining a deeper understanding of the MGBA, it may be possible to facilitate research into microbial-based pharmacological interventions and therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases.

## 92. The gut microbiota-immune-brain axis: Therapeutic implications.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis has major implications for human health including gastrointestinal physiology, brain function, and behavior. The immune system represents a key pathway of communication along this axis with the microbiome implicated in neuroinflammation in health and disease. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms as to how the gut microbiota interacts with the brain, focusing on innate and adaptive immunity that are often disrupted in gut-brain axis disorders. We also consider the implications of these observations and how they can be advanced by interdisciplinary research. Leveraging an increased understanding of how these interactions regulate immunity has the potential to usher in a new era of precision neuropsychiatric clinical interventions for psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and neurological disorders.

## 93. Modulation of the Neuro-Cancer Connection by Metabolites of Gut Microbiota.

The gut-brain-cancer axis represents a novel and intricate connection between the gut microbiota, neurobiology, and cancer progression. Recent advances have accentuated the significant role of gut microbiota metabolites in modulating systemic processes that influence both brain health and tumorigenesis. This paper explores the emerging concept of metabolite-mediated modulation within the gut-brain-cancer connection, focusing on key metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan derivatives, secondary bile acids, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). While the gut microbiota's impact on immune regulation, neuroinflammation, and tumor development is well established, gaps remain in grasping how specific metabolites contribute to neuro-cancer interactions. We discuss novel metabolites with potential implications for neurobiology and cancer, such as indoles and polyamines, which have yet to be extensively studied. Furthermore, we review preclinical and clinical evidence linking gut dysbiosis, altered metabolite profiles, and brain tumors, showcasing limitations and research gaps, particularly in human longitudinal studies. Case studies investigating microbiota-based interventions, including dietary changes, fecal microbiota transplantation, and probiotics, demonstrate promise but also indicate hurdles in translating these findings to clinical cancer therapies. This paper concludes with a call for standardized multi-omics approaches and bi-directional research frameworks integrating microbiome, neuroscience, and oncology to develop personalized therapeutic strategies for neuro-cancer patients.

## 94. Gut microbiota and their influence in brain cancer milieu.

Microbial communities are not simply remnants of the past but dynamic entities that continuously evolve under the selective pressures of nature, reflecting the intricate and adaptive processes of evolution. The microbiota residing in the various regions of the human body has numerous roles in different physiological processes such as nutrition, metabolism, immune regulation, etc. In the zeal of achieving empirical insights into the ambit of the gut microbiome, the research over the years led to the revelation of reciprocal interaction between the gut microbiome and the cognitive functioning of the human body. Dysbiosis in the gut microbial composition disturbs the homeostatic cognitive functioning of the human body. This dysbiosis has been associated with various chronic diseases, including brain cancer, such as glioma, glioblastoma, etc. This review explores the mechanistic role of dysbiosis-mediated progression of brain cancers and their subtypes. Moreover, it demonstrates the regulatory role of microbial metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, such as short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, lipids, etc., in the tumour progression. Further, we also provide valuable insights into the microbiota mediating the efficiency of therapeutic regimens, thereby leveraging gut microbiota as potential biomarkers and targets for improved treatment outcomes.

## 95. Elucidating the specific mechanisms of the gut-brain axis: the short-chain fatty acids-microglia pathway. Microbiota and Inflammatory Markers: A Review of Their Interplay, Clinical Implications, and Metabolic Disorders.

In recent years, the gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized for its influence on various central nervous system diseases mediated by microglia, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. As key metabolites of the gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have emerged as a focal point in understanding microglia-related interactions. In this review, we further refine the connection between the gut microbiota and microglia by introducing the concept of the "SCFAs-microglia" pathway. We summarize current knowledge on this pathway, recent discoveries regarding its role in neurological diseases, and potential pharmacological strategies targeting it. Finally, we outlined the current challenges and limitations in this field of research. We hope this review provides new insights into the role of the gut microbiota in neuroimmune regulation. The human microbiota, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms, plays a pivotal role in regulating host immunity and metabolism. This review investigates the interplay between microbiota and inflammatory markers, emphasizing their impact on metabolic and autoimmune disorders. Key inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), zonulin (ZO-1), and netrin-1 (Ntn1), are discussed in the context of intestinal barrier integrity and chronic inflammation. Dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in microbial composition and function, directly modulates the levels and activity of these biomarkers, exacerbating inflammatory responses and compromising epithelial barriers. The disruption of microbiota is further correlated with increased intestinal permeability and chronic inflammation, serving as a precursor to conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, this review examines therapeutic strategies, including probiotics and prebiotics, designed to restore microbial balance, mitigate inflammation, and enhance metabolic homeostasis. Emerging evidence positions microbiota-targeted interventions as critical components in the advancement of precision medicine, offering promising avenues for diagnosing and treating inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

## 96. Gut-Brain Axis and Brain Microbiome Interactions from a Medical Perspective.

Background: The gut microbiome directly impacts brain health and activity, meaning the two are closely associated. This relationship suggests a link between microbial imbalances and diseases such as Alzheimer's, although multiple other contributing factors, such as genetics, also play a part. Additionally, recent studies discovered that cerebrospinal fluid has some microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which can be interpreted to mean a microbiome exists in the brain too. The vagus nerve and the central nervous and immune systems are responsible for the connection between the brain and gut microbiome. Aims and Objectives: The main aim of this systematic review is to analyze existing research on the gut-brain axis and the brain microbiome to fill the current knowledge gap. Materials and Methods: A search was conducted on the PubMed database based on a set of predefined MeSH terms. Results: After the search, 2716 articles meeting the MeSH parameters were found in PubMed. This list was then downloaded and analyzed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 63 relevant papers were selected. Discussion: Bacteria in the gut microbiome produce some substances that are considered neuroactive. These compounds can directly or indirectly affect brain function through the gut-brain axis. However, various knowledge gaps on the mechanisms involved in this connection need to be addressed first.

## 97. From Microbial Homeostasis to Systemic Pathogenesis: A Narrative Review on Gut Flora's Role in Neuropsychiatric, Metabolic, and Cancer Disorders.

As a pivotal ecological regulator in humans, the gut microbiota profoundly participates in the pathological processes of neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancers through metabolite exchange, epigenetic regulation, and gut-brain axis signaling. This review focuses on analyzing relationships between gut microbial communities and four major disease spectra: neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease)-revealing microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharide activation of microglia and gut-brain transmission pathways of α-synuclein; mental health disorders (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder)-elucidating dysregulated tryptophan metabolism and gut-derived neurotransmitter imbalances; metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes, gout)-analyzing molecular mechanisms by which short-chain fatty acids regulate insulin sensitivity and uric acid metabolism; malignant tumors (lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer)-exploring microbial remodeling of immune checkpoint inhibitor responses and regulatory effects on estrogen metabolism. We integrate existing evidence to systematically expound the roles of gut microbiota alterations in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, metabolic dysregulation, and malignant tumors, with in-depth analysis of mechanisms through which dysbiosis promotes disease progression, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation and scientific recommendations for developing microbiota-targeted precision intervention strategies (including, but not limited to synthetic microbial community transplantation and metabolite-directed regulation).

## 98. Bridging the brain and gut: neuroimmune mechanisms of neuroinflammation and therapeutic insights.

The central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system are profoundly interconnected, engaging in a continuous dynamic exchange that regulates homeostasis, immune surveillance, and responses to injury. These interactions occur through diverse mechanisms, ranging from microglial activation and cytokine signaling to peripheral immune cell infiltration. When disrupted, this balance contributes to neurodegenerative processes, affecting cognitive function and neuronal survival. This mini-review examines the cellular and molecular foundations of neuroimmune communication, focusing on how neuroimmune interactions influence the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Key mechanisms include barrier systems, gut-brain interactions, and circadian rhythm regulation, all playing a crucial role in modulating neuroinflammatory responses. The gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in modulating CNS function, as alterations in gut microbiota composition can trigger neuroinflammatory pathways, affect systemic immunity, and influence disease susceptibility. Both innate and adaptive immune responses are instrumental in shaping disease trajectory, highlighting the complex interplay between systemic and neural immune components. The blood-brain barrier and glymphatic system modulate immune cell trafficking and waste clearance, influencing CNS pathology. Additionally, circadian rhythm and sleep patterns regulate neuroimmune balance, with disruptions exacerbating inflammation and neurodegeneration. Neuroimmune crosstalk manifests through a spectrum of pathways, each capable of either promoting resilience or accelerating neurodegeneration. By unraveling these connections, we can gain new insights into potential strategies to modulate immune responses and restore homeostasis. This investigation underlines the necessity of integrative approaches that target immune modulation, microbiota regulation, and circadian alignment to mitigate neurodegenerative disease progression and improve therapeutic outcomes.

## 99. The progress of the microbe-gut-brain axis in sepsis-associated encephalopathy.

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse brain dysfunction that is caused by sepsis without direct brain injury or central nervous system infection and is manifested as anxiety-like behavior and cognitive dysfunction. The microbiota-gut-brain axis, on the other hand, is a bidirectional communication network between the gut and the brain that modulates host behavior and cognitive function in many ways and is of central importance in the preservation of general health and homeostasis. Given the functional roles attributed to the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), contemporary research is progressively focused on elucidating relationships between SAE and alterations in compositional and quantitative intestinal microbiota profiles. This review consolidates interdisciplinary insights from immunology, microbiology, neuroendocrine signaling, and neural pathophysiology to evaluate the mechanistic contribution of the MGBA to the relief of cognitive impairments in SAE. By unifying these perspectives, with the aim of preventing or enhancing SAE-related neurological dysfunction for the formulation of MGBA-targeted therapeutic strategies.

## 100. An Updated and Comprehensive Review Exploring the Gut-Brain Axis in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Neurotraumas: Implications for Therapeutic Strategies.

The gut-brain axis (GBA) refers to the biochemical bidirectional communication between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract, linking brain and gut functions. It comprises a complex network of interactions involving the endocrine, immune, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. The balance of this bidirectional pathway depends on the composition of the gut microbiome and its metabolites. While the causes of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) vary, the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in their development and prognosis. NDDs are often associated with an inflammation-related gut microbiome. However, restoring balance to the gut microbiome and reducing inflammation may have therapeutic benefits. In particular, introducing short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, key metabolites that support gut homeostasis, can help counteract the inflammatory microbiome. This strong pathological link between the gut and NDDs underscores the gut-brain axis (GBA) as a promising target for therapeutic intervention. This review, by scrutinizing the more recent original research articles published in PubMed (MEDLINE) database, emphasizes the emerging notion that GBA is an equally important pathological marker for neurological movement disorders, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease and neurotraumatic disorders such as traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Additionally, the GBA presents a promising therapeutic target for managing these diseases.

## 101. The regulation of neuroinflammatory response after stroke by intestinal flora microorganisms.

Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe central nervous system disorder characterized by high incidence, disability, mortality, and recurrence rates, along with numerous complications. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a bidirectional communication pathway between the brain and the gut, which can influence the onset and progression of IS through neural, immunoregulatory, and gut metabolite pathways. Recent preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics and prebiotics, dietary interventions, and antibiotics as strategies to suppress neuroinflammation in IS, protect the blood-brain barrier, modulate immune responses, and improve stroke outcomes. In this review, we summarize the manifestations of innate inflammation and adaptive immunity following the onset of IS, highlight the interactions between the MGBA and post-stroke neuroinflammation, and discuss current therapeutic measures, thus providing insights for the development of novel treatment strategies in the future.

## 102. Intestinal barrier damage caused by addictive substance use disorder.

Addictive substance use disorder has a wide range of effects on the intestinal barrier, including damage to the biological, chemical, mechanical, and immune barriers. Damage to the intestinal barrier caused by addictive substance use disorder allows harmful substances and bacteria to cross the intestinal barrier into the circulatory system, leading to systemic inflammatory responses and immune imbalances. In addition, the interaction between the gut flora and the central nervous system is recognized as an important component of the gut-brain axis. Gut barrier damage leads to dysbiosis, which in turn affects brain function by activating immune cells and releasing inflammatory factors. This may lead to altered mood and cognitive function, increased addictive substance cravings, and dependence. Recent research has indicated that reshaping the gut-brain axis and adjusting the composition and abundance of gut microbiota holds promise in alleviating withdrawal symptoms with addictive substance dependence. This article reviews the effects of addictive substance use disorder on the intestinal barrier and explores the possibility of improving addictive substance dependence by treating gut barrier damage.

## 103. The role of brain-liver-gut Axis in neurological disorders.

In recent years, with the increasing volume of related research, it has become apparent that the liver and gut play important roles in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Considering the interactions among the brain, liver, and gut, the brain-liver-gut axis has been proposed and gradually recognized. In this article, we summarized the complex network of interactions within the brain-liver-gut axis, encompassing the vagus nerve, barrier permeability, immunity and inflammation, the blood-brain barrier, gut microbial metabolites, the gut barrier, neurotoxic metabolites, and beta-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism. We also elaborated on the impact of the brain-liver-gut axis on various neurological disorders. Furthermore, we outline several therapies aimed at modulating the brain-liver-gut axis, including antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and dietary interventions. The focus is on elucidating possible mechanisms underlying neurological disorders pathogenesis and identifying effective treatments that are based on our understanding of the brain-liver-gut axis.

## 104. Systematic review and meta-analysis of microbiota-gut-astrocyte axis perturbation in neurodegeneration, brain injury, and mood disorders.

BACKGROUND: Astrocytes are essential for preserving homeostasis, maintaining the blood-brain barrier, and they are a key element of the tripartite neuronal synapse. Despite such multifaceted roles, their importance as contributors to the microbiota-gut-brain axis studies, which typically focus on microglia and neurons, has been largely overlooked. This meta-analysis provides the first systematic review of the microbiota-gut-astrocyte (MGA) axis in vivo, integrating findings across distinct neurological diseases. METHODS: A systematic narrative review was conducted per PRISMA guidelines. The search term employed for PubMed was "Microbiota"[MeSH] AND (astrocyte OR glial) NOT (Review[Publication Type]) and for Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus, "Microbio∗ AND (astrocyte OR glial)" with filters applied to exclude review articles. Searches were completed by May 9th(,) 2024. Data extracted included study models, interventions, and outcomes related to astrocyte biology and rodent behaviour. SYRCLE's risk of bias tool was used to assess individual study designs. RESULTS: 53 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering rodent models of stroke and traumatic (acute) brain injury, chronic neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and other heterogeneous models of cognitive impairment and affective disorders. Significant heterogeneity in methodology was observed between studies. Five studies had a high risk of bias, and 15 were low risk. Astrocyte biology, typically measured by GFAP expression, was increased in neurodegeneration and acute brain injury models but varied significantly in mood disorder models, depending on the source of stress. Common findings across diseases included altered gut microbiota, particularly an increased Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and compromised gut barrier integrity, linked to increased GFAP expression. Faecal microbiota transplants and microbial metabolite analyses suggested a direct impact of the gut microbiota on astrocyte biology and markers of neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: This review and meta-analysis describes the impact of the gut microbiota on astrocyte biology, and argues that the MGA axis is a promising therapeutic target for neurological disorders. However, it is clear that our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and astrocyte behaviour is incomplete, including how different subtypes of astrocytes may be affected. Future studies must adopt new, multi-dimensional studies of astrocyte function and dysfunction, to elucidate their role in disease and explore the therapeutic potential of gut microbiota modulation.

## 105. Neurodevelopmental disorders and gut-brain interactions: exploring the therapeutic potential of pycnogenol through microbial-metabolic-neural networks.

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), characterized by cognitive impairments and behavioral abnormalities, represent a clinically diverse group of conditions typically emerging during childhood or adolescence. Major subtypes encompass autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and epilepsy. The pathogenesis of these disorders involves multifactorial interactions between genetic susceptibility (Shank3 mutations in ASD), environmental triggers (prenatal toxins), neurotransmitter dysregulation (dopamine (GA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems) and immune dysregulation. Growing research highlights the gut-brain axis disruption as a potential contributor to NDDs pathophysiology, though systematic evaluation of therapeutic approaches targeting this axis and related gastrointestinal comorbidities (GIDs) remains limited. This review comprehensively examines the pathological mechanisms underlying ADHD, ASD, and epilepsy, while analyzing the reciprocal relationship between gut-brain axis dysregulation and GID manifestations in NDDs. Notably, abnormal activation of key signaling pathways including NF-κB, MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of NDDs. We further propose pycnogenol (PYC), a polyphenol extract of pine bark, as a natural compound with multiple bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, can directly or indirectly affect the function of the gut-brain axis by regulating the structure of the intestinal microbial community (increasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and butyric acid-producing bacteria) and its metabolites, providing a new strategy for the treatment of NDDs.

## 106. The relationship between gut microbiome and human diseases: mechanisms, predisposing factors and potential intervention.

The complex interrelation of gut microbiota with human health underlines the profound influence this microbial ecosystem has on mechanisms of disease and wellness. The gut microbiome profoundly impacts various human diseases, encompassing gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic disorders, neurological disorders, and immune-related diseases. Gastrointestinal disorders are closely linked to microbial imbalances in the gut. Metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, are influenced by the gut microbiota's role in energy regulation and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis highlights the correlation between gut microbiota and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Moreover, the gut microbiome assumes a pivotal function in regulating the immune system, whereby dysbiosis is implicated in developing immunological-related ailments, including allergies and autoimmune disorders. Predisposing factors, including diet, medicines, lifestyle, and environmental influences, are described as having an important role in the composition of the gut microbiome. By understanding these factors, we can get valuable insights into how to intervene to reduce the chances of a disease. Current interventions, including probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplants, and lifestyle modification, show promise, but there are still challenges and unanswered questions in this evolving field that may lead to improvements. This review interrelates the complicated gut microbiome with various human diseases, mechanisms, predisposing factors, and potential interventions.

## 107. Gut-brain axis and vascular dementia: a review on mechanisms and Chinese herbal medicine therapeutics.

Vascular dementia (VD), the second most prevalent form of dementia among the elderly population, is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized primarily by cognitive impairment. Emerging evidence has revealed that intestinal flora dysbiosis may be implicated not only in gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies but also in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including VD. The gut-brain axis (GBA) serves as a critical bidirectional pathway through which intestinal flora influences brain physiology and function. Notably, accumulating studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in VD management via modulation of gut microbial composition. This review synthesizes current understanding of the VD- intestinal flora relationship mediated by the GBA, while systematically evaluating evidence for CHM interventions that ameliorate VD through intestinal flora regulation. These insights may offer novel perspectives and methodological approaches for both fundamental research and clinical management of VD.

## 108. Advances in Autophagy-Lysosomal Pathway and Neurodegeneration via Brain-Gut Axis.

Background/Objectives: The autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is crucial for neuronal health by clearing misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. While much research has focused on ALP dysfunction in the central nervous system, new evidence shows its importance in the gut, where it affects neurodegeneration via the gut-brain axis. Past reviews have mainly studied the ALP's direct neuroprotective effects or the gut microbiota's role in neurodegeneration separately. However, the two-way relationship between the ALP and the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. We combine the latest findings on the ALP's role in gut health, microbial imbalance, and neuroinflammation, providing a comprehensive view of their combined effects in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Methods: This narrative review synthesizes evidence from preclinical, clinical, and translational studies (2014-2025) to explore the interplay between the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. The literature was identified via PubMed and Web of Science using search terms including autophagy, lysosome, gut microbiota, neurodegeneration, and gut-brain axis, with additional manual screening of reference lists. The inclusion criteria prioritized studies elucidating molecular mechanisms (e.g., ALP-microbiota crosstalk), while excluding case reports or non-peer-reviewed sources. Results: The gut-brain axis facilitates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through neural, immune, and metabolic pathways. Autophagy dysfunction may disrupt intestinal homeostasis, promote gut microbiota dysbiosis, and trigger chronic neuroinflammation, ultimately accelerating neurodegeneration. Notably, strategies targeting the gut microbiota and restoring intestinal barrier function via the ALP have demonstrated promising potential in delaying the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Conclusions: This review establishes the ALP as a dynamic regulator of gut-brain communication, highlighting microbiota-targeted therapies as promising strategies for neurodegeneration.

## 109. The Bidirectional Relationship Between the Gut Microbiome and Mental Health: A Comprehensive Review.

The gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in mental health, influencing mood, cognition, and emotional regulation through the gut-brain axis. This bidirectional communication system connects the gastrointestinal and CNS, facilitated by microbial metabolites, neurotransmitters, and immune interactions. Recent research highlights the association between gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and stress-related conditions. Key findings indicate that altered microbial diversity, decreased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and increased neuroinflammation contribute to mental health disturbances. This paper explores the mechanism linking the gut microbiome to brain function, including microbial neurotransmitter synthesis, vagus nerve signaling, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis modulation. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of microbiome-targeted interventions, such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in alleviating psychiatric symptoms. Microbiome sequencing and bioinformatics advances further support the development of personalized microbiome-based mental health interventions. Despite promising evidence, challenges such as inter-individual variability, methodological inconsistencies, and the need for longitudinal studies remain. Future research should focus on standardizing microbiome assessment techniques and optimizing therapeutic applications. Integrating precision psychiatry with microbiome-based diagnostics holds immense potential in transforming mental health treatment.

## 110. Gut Feelings: How Microbes, Diet, and Host Immunity Shape Disease.

The human gut microbiome is intricately linked to systemic and organ-specific immune responses and is highly responsive to dietary modulation. As metagenomic techniques enable in-depth study of an ever-growing number of gut microbial species, it has become increasingly feasible to decipher the specific functions of the gut microbiome and how they may be modulated by diet. Diet exerts both supportive and selective pressures on the gut microbiome by regulating a multitude of factors, including energy density, macronutrient and micronutrient content, and circadian rhythm. The microbiome, in turn, contributes to local and systemic immune responses by providing colonization resistance against pathogens, shaping immune cell activity and differentiation, and facilitating the production of bioactive metabolites. Emerging research has strengthened the connections between the gut microbiome and cardiometabolic disorders (e.g., cardiovascular disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes), autoimmune conditions (e.g., type-1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease), respiratory disease, chronic kidney and liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, depressive disorders). Here, we outline ways in which dietary factors impact host response in diseases through alterations of gut microbiome functionality and composition. Consideration of diet-mediated microbial effects within the context of the diseases discussed highlights the potential of microbiome-targeted treatment strategies as alternative or adjunct therapies to improve patient outcomes.

## 111. Stress-Induced Sleep Dysregulation: The Roles of Astrocytes and Microglia in Neurodegenerative and Psychiatric Disorders.

Stress and sleep share a reciprocal relationship, where chronic stress often leads to sleep disturbances that worsen neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. Non-neuronal cells, particularly astrocytes and microglia, play critical roles in the brain's response to stress and the regulation of sleep. Astrocytes influence sleep architecture by regulating adenosine signaling and glymphatic clearance, both of which can be disrupted by chronic stress, leading to reduced restorative sleep. Microglia, activated under stress conditions, drive neuroinflammatory processes that further impair sleep and exacerbate brain dysfunction. Additionally, the gut-brain axis mediates interactions between stress, sleep, and inflammation, with microbial metabolites influencing neural pathways. Many of these effects converge on the disruption of synaptic processes, such as neurotransmitter balance, synaptic plasticity, and pruning, which in turn contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. This review explores how these cellular and systemic mechanisms contribute to stress-induced sleep disturbances and their implications for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting non-neuronal cells and the gut-brain axis.

## 112. Effects of psychological stress on inflammatory bowel disease via affecting the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic intestinal inflammatory condition with chronic and relapsing manifestations and is characterized by a disturbance in the interplay between the intestinal microbiota, the gut, and the brain. The microbiota-gut-brain axis involves interactions among the nervous system, the neuroendocrine system, the gut microbiota, and the host immune system. Increasing published data indicate that psychological stress exacerbates the severity of IBD due to its negative effects on the microbiota-gut-brain axis, including alterations in the stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the balance between the sympathetic nervous system and vagus nerves, the homeostasis of the intestinal flora and metabolites, and normal intestinal immunity and permeability. Although the current evidence is insufficient, psychotropic agents, psychotherapies, and interventions targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis show the potential to improve symptoms and quality of life in IBD patients. Therefore, further studies that translate recent findings into therapeutic approaches that improve both physical and psychological well-being are needed.

## 113. Gut microbiota: a new target for the prevention and treatment of insomnia using Chinese herbal medicines and their active components.

The emergence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis has opened new avenues for improving sleep quality. Recent studies have revealed a close relationship between insomnia and the gut microbiome. Chinese herbal medicines and their active components can alter the relative abundance of sleep-related gut microbiota by reversing dysbiosis in the gut microbiome. Improving sleep quality through the regulation of the gut microbiota using herbal medicine and its active components has become a highly promising therapeutic strategy. This article elucidates how the gut microbiota modulates sleep quality via the intricate communication network of the gut-brain axis. It also reviews the latest research on utilizing herbal medicine and its active components to regulate the gut microbiota for enhancing sleep quality. Additionally, it provides insights into the potential of herbal medicine and its active components in improving sleep quality through the modulation of the gut microbiota.

## 114. Autism Spectrum Disorder, Oral Implications, and Oral Microbiota. Isorhamnetin Alleviates Inflammation-Induced Crosstalk between Kynurenine Pathway and Gut Microbiota in Depressed Mice.

Background/Objectives: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Recent evidence indicates a significant relationship between ASD and imbalances in microbiota, particularly in the oral and gastrointestinal areas. This review examines the impact of oral microbiota, self-injurious behaviors (SIB), sensory sensitivity, and dietary choices on the comorbidities associated with ASD. Methods: An extensive literature review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus. The focus was on human studies with full-text availability, utilizing search terms related to ASD, oral health, oral microbiota, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The research was evaluated for methodological quality and its relevance to the connections between microbiota, oral health, and ASD. Results: Individuals with ASD face unique oral health challenges, including injuries from self-injurious behaviors and increased sensory sensitivity, which complicate oral hygiene and care. Selective eating can lead to nutritional deficiencies and worsen oral health issues. Dysbiosis in oral and gut microbiota, marked by altered levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, interferes with gut-brain and oral-brain connections, contributing to behavioral and neurological symptoms. Treatment options such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transfer, and sensory integration therapies can potentially alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Conclusions: The relationship between ASD, oral health, and microbiota suggests a bidirectional influence through neuroinflammatory mechanisms and metabolic disturbances. Proactive strategies focusing on microbiota and dental health may help reduce comorbidities and enhance the overall management of ASD, underscoring the need for further research into microbiota-host interactions and their therapeutic potential. Depression is a widespread psychiatric disorder with complex pathogenesis and unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. As a native flavonoid, Isorhamnetin (ISO) has been deemed to exert neuroprotective effects by antioxidation and regulation of immunity. However, no reports of anti-depressed effect of ISO have yet been found. The present study was conducted to clarify the mechanism basis of anti-depressed effect of ISO utilizing behavioral, biochemical, molecular approaches in vitro and in vivo and bio-informatics analysis. The effects of ISO on depressed mice was investigated through the SPT and FST, and the lesions were examined by H&E staining. Besides, the inflammatory factor and indicator in kynurenine pathway were assessed through detection kits, and the microbiota were checked by 16sRNA. Molecular docking study was performed to investigate the target of ISO. Additionally, Western blot was used to test the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The results indicated that ISO could enhance the sugar water preference of mice in SPT and reduce immobility time in FST. Further more, ISO suppressed peripheral and central inflammation, regulated the changes in kynurenine pathway and gut microbiota, inhibited activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, and presented good binding patterns with target proteins on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that ISO alleviated depression-like behaviour by normalizing inflammation-induced dysregulation of the crosstalk between KP and gut microbiota disorder through regulated PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway.

## 115. Bidirectional modulation of Alzheimer's disease via gut microbiota: rescue by fecal transplantation from healthy donors and aggravation by colitis-associated dysbiosis.

INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence implicates gut microbiota dysbiosis as a key modulator for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) via the gut-brain axis. To investigate the causal role of microbial communities in AD progression, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice using donor microbiota from healthy wild-type mice or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. METHODS: Cognitive function, amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were assessed in mice. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of gut microbiota and bioinformatic functional analyses were applied to identify the specific microbial communities potentially involved in AD progression. RESULTS: FMT-WT mice (fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy wild-type mice) exhibited significant improvements in spatial memory (Morris Water Maze), exploratory behavior (Y-maze), and locomotor activity (Open Field Test), alongside reduced Aβ plaque burden and normalized expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) in both gut and brain tissues. Conversely, FMT-DSS mice (fecal microbiota transplantation from DSS-treated donors) displayed exacerbated cognitive deficits, heightened Aβ deposition, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Microbial profiling revealed stark contrasts: FMT-WT mice harbored beneficial taxa (Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae) linked to anti-inflammatory products like short-chain fatty acid, while FMT-DSS mice showed blooms of pathogenic genera (Erysipelatoclostridium, Enterobacteriaceae) associated with neurotoxic metabolites. Functional analyses predicted enrichment of neuroprotective pathways (e.g., lysine metabolism) in FMT-WT and pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g., carbon metabolism) in FMT-DSS. Crucially, neuroinflammation occurred independently of gut barrier disruption, implicating circulating microbial metabolites as key mediators. DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that gut microbiota composition bidirectionally influences AD progression, with FMT from healthy donors attenuating neuroinflammation and pathology, while colitis-associated dysbiosis exacerbates disease hallmarks. Our study positions microbiota-targeted therapies as a promising strategy to modulate AD progression through the gut-brain axis.

## 116. Matrix Dynamics and Microbiome Crosstalk: Matrix Metalloproteinases as Key Players in Disease and Therapy.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key enzymes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, regulating a wide range of cellular and immune processes in both homeostatic and pathological conditions. Host-microbiota interactions play a critical role in maintaining ECM balance; however, during dysbiosis, this regulation is disrupted, leading to compromised barrier integrity, pathogen translocation into circulation, and the development of systemic diseases and cancer. This review highlights the bidirectional relationship between MMP expression/activity and microbiota dysbiosis, emphasizing tissue-specific alterations in MMP activity that contribute to disease progression. In addition, it integrates interdisciplinary evidence to illustrate the MMP-dependent mechanisms underlying various pathologies associated with oral and gut microbiome dysbiosis, including long-range effects through the gut-skin and gut-brain axes. Thus, this review introduces the emerging field of MatrixBiome, which explores the complex interactions between the ECM, microbiota, and host tissues. Finally, it also outlines therapeutic strategies to modulate MMP levels, either indirectly through microbiome-targeted approaches (e.g., prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics) or directly using MMP inhibitors, offering promising avenues for future clinical interventions.

## 117. Flavanones as Modulators of Gut Microbiota and Cognitive Function.

Flavanones, a key subclass of flavonoids, exhibit a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Predominantly found in citrus fruits, they occur in both aglycone and glycosylated forms, undergoing extensive metabolic transformation upon ingestion. Recent evidence suggests that flavanones, such as naringenin and hesperidin, influence gut microbiota composition, fostering a balance between beneficial and pathogenic bacterial populations. The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in regulating the gut-brain axis, impacting cognitive function through the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), neurotransmitters, and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The modulation of the gut microbiome by flavanones has been associated with improvements in cognitive performance and a reduced risk of neurodegenerative disorders. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of major flavanones, their metabolic pathways, and their impact on gut microbiota and cognitive function. It covers the fundamental mechanisms through which flavanones exert their effects, as well as their potential therapeutic applications for brain health and neuroprotection. Despite promising findings, further research is needed to determine optimal dosages, strategies to enhance bioavailability, and long-term safety profiles.

## 118. Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and gut-brain axes in biological interaction pathway of the depression.

The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and gut-brain axes are vital biological pathways in depression. The HPA axis regulates the body's stress response, and chronic stress can lead to overactivation of the HPA axis, resulting in elevated cortisol levels that contribute to neuronal damage, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, both of which are involved in mood regulation and mental disorders. In parallel, the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, influences emotional and cognitive functions. Imbalances in gut microbiota can affect the HPA axis, promoting inflammation and increasing gut permeability. This allows endotoxins to enter the bloodstream, contributing to neuroinflammation and altering neurotransmitter production, including serotonin. Since the majority of serotonin is produced in the gut, disruptions in this pathway may be linked to depressive symptoms. This review explores the interplay between the HPA axis and the gut-brain axis in the context of depression.

## 119. Can the gut-brain axis provide insight into psilocybin's therapeutic value in reducing stress?

There is growing interest in exploring the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of psilocybin on stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), addiction, and disordered eating. Despite promising progressions in preclinical and clinical research, the neurobiological and physiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psilocybin remain complex, involving multiple systems with numerous homeostatic feedback signaling pathways throughout the body. This review paper explores how psilocybin mechanistically interacts with the gut microbiota, enteric nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and how psilocybin influences the bidirectional communication between peripheral and neuronal systems. Shifting towards a more integrated paradigm to unravel the mechanisms through which psilocybin affects the bidirectional gut-brain axis holds the promise of significantly advancing our understanding of psilocybin-based therapies from preparation of treatment, administration, to proceeding long-term integration. Such an understanding can extend beyond the treatment of psychiatric disorders, further encompassing a broader spectrum of inflammatory-related disorders.

## 120. Gut Microbiota: An Immersion in Dysbiosis, Associated Pathologies, and Probiotics.

The importance of the microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota and its implications for health, is well established. However, an increasing number of studies further strengthen the link between an imbalanced gut microbiota and a greater predisposition to different diseases. The gut microbiota constitutes a fundamental ecosystem for maintaining human health. Its alteration, known as dysbiosis, is associated with a wide range of conditions, including intestinal, metabolic, immunological, or neurological pathologies, among others. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in knowledge about probiotics-bacterial species that enhance health or address various diseases-with numerous studies reporting their benefits in preventing or improving these conditions. This review aims to analyze the most common pathologies resulting from an imbalance in the gut microbiota, as well as detail the most important and known gut probiotics, their functions, and mechanisms of action in relation to these conditions.

## 121. Ketogenic Diet and Gut Microbiota: Exploring New Perspectives on Cognition and Mood.

The ketogenic diet (KD) is a dietary regimen characterized by low carbohydrate intake and moderate protein levels, designed to simulate a fasting state and induce ketosis for the production of ketone bodies from fat. Emerging research underscores KD's potential in improving cognitive functions and regulating mood. Investigations into its safety and efficacy have centered on its anti-inflammatory properties and its impact on neurological health and the gut-brain axis (GBA). This review delves into the relationship between the KD and gut microbiota, emphasizing its potential role in cognitive enhancement and mood stabilization, particularly for managing mood disorders and depression. The investigation of the KD's physiological effects and its role in promoting cognition and emotion through gut microbiota will pave the way for innovative approaches to personalized dietary interventions.

## 122. Research focus and trends of the association between gut microbiota and neuroinflammation.

BACKGROUND: The interaction between the gut microbiota and neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, particularly neurodegenerative diseases, and has become one of the focal points of research in recent years. Despite the large number of related studies, there is currently a lack of comprehensive analysis and prediction of these data to drive the field forward. This study aims to systematically analyze the clinical practices and research hotspots of the underlying mechanisms in this field using bibliometric and visualization methods, and to explore the future development pathways. METHODS: CiteSpace, VOSviewer, GraphPad Prism and other software were used to analyze 1,404 studies on gut microbiota and neuroinflammation collected by the core of the Web of Science since 2000, to visually present the collaborative network between literatures, structure of authors and countries, co-occurrence of keywords, emerging reference literature, and research hotspots. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2024, the number of related papers on this topic showed an overall upward trend, and the annual citation peaked in 2020, with significant contributions from China and the United States. Research focused on the relationship between gut microbiota and neuroinflammation, with a particular emphasis on investigating the mechanisms of the microbiota-gut-brain axis through both basic and clinical research. Treatment strategies include probiotic therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation and traditional Chinese medicine. CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively reviews the research progress on the association between gut microbiota and neuroinflammation, and discusses the current research focus and frontier directions of this relationship, so as to provide reference for the development of this field.

## 123. Bridging traditional Chinese medicine and Alzheimer’s disease: the pivotal role of gut microbiota in multitarget therapeutic mechanisms.

Microbiota-gut-brain axis communication represents another crucial pathway in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whereby gut microbiota significantly impacts AD pathology by modulating immune, metabolic, digestive, and neurological functions. Although research on treating AD through gut microbiota interventions is advancing, substantial breakthroughs remain limited. Given AD’s complex pathological mechanisms, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a clear advantage with its multi-target effects. During the processes of TCM intake, absorption, and therapeutic action, the gut microbiota serves both as a mediator and as a therapeutic target. However, the mechanisms by which TCM interacts with gut microbiota to exert beneficial effects on AD remain largely unclarified. Here, we review the mechanisms through which TCM may intervene in AD from the perspective of gut microbiota, examining the potential mechanisms and clinical application prospects of Chinese herbal medicine in regulating the gut microbiome. This provides a novel theoretical foundation and methodological support for further research into herbal therapies for AD.

## 124. Engineered Tissue Models to Decode Host-Microbiota Interactions.

A mutualistic co-evolution exists between the host and its associated microbiota in the human body. Bacteria establish ecological niches in various tissues of the body, locally influencing their physiology and functions, but also contributing to the well-being of the whole organism through systemic communication with other distant niches (axis). Emerging evidence indicates that when the composition of the microbiota inhabiting the niche changes toward a pathogenic state (dysbiosis) and interactions with the host become unbalanced, diseases may present. In addition, imbalances within a single niche can cause dysbiosis in distant organs. Current research efforts are focused on elucidating the mechanisms leading to dysbiosis, with the goal of restoring tissue homeostasis. In vitro models can provide critical experimental platforms to address this need, by reproducing the niche cyto-architecture and physiology with high fidelity. This review surveys current in in vitro host-microbiota research strategies and provides a roadmap that can guide the field in further developing physiologically relevant in vitro models of ecological niches, thus enabling investigation of the role of the microbiota in human health and diseases. Lastly, given the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act 2.0, this review highlights emerging in vitro strategies to support the development and validation of new therapies on the market.

## 125. Leaky Gut Biomarkers as Predictors of Depression and Suicidal Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Background: The gut-brain axis (GBA) has been demonstrated to be involved in normal neurodevelopment, with its dysfunction potentially contributing to the onset of mental disorders. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to examine the relationship between levels of specific biomarkers of intestinal permeability or inflammation and scores of depressive symptoms or suicidality. Methods: All studies investigating the link between depressive symptoms and/or suicidality and biomarkers associated with intestinal permeability or inflammation were included. Studies providing data for comparisons between two groups-depressive or suicidal patients vs. healthy controls, or suicidal vs. non-suicidal patients-were included in the meta-analysis. Studies examining the correlation between depressive symptoms and biomarker levels were also included into the review. Data were independently extracted and reviewed by multiple observers. A random-effects model was employed for the analysis, and Hedge's g was pooled for the effect size. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) index. Results: Twenty-two studies provided data for inclusion in the meta-analysis, while nineteen studies investigated the correlation between depressive symptoms and biomarker levels. For depressive symptoms, when compared to the controls, patients showed significantly increased levels of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) (ES = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.61; p = 0.004; I(2) = 71.61%), zonulin (ES = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.02 to 1.36; p = 0.044; I(2) = 92.12%), antibodies against bacterial endotoxins (ES = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.98; p < 0.001; I(2) = 0.00%), and sCD14 (ES = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.21; p = 0.038; I(2) = 10.28%). No significant differences were found between the patients and controls in levels of LPS-binding protein (LBP) and alpha-1 antitrypsin (A-1-AT). For suicidality, four studies were identified for quantitative analysis, three of which focused on I-FABP. No significant differences in I-FABP levels were observed between suicidal patients and the controls (ES = 0.24; 95% CI = -0.30 to 0.79; p = 0.378; I(2) = 86.44%). Studies investigating the correlation between depressive symptoms and levels of intestinal permeability and inflammation biomarkers did not provide conclusive results. Conclusions: A significant difference was observed between patients with depressive symptoms and controls for biomarkers of intestinal permeability (zonulin, which regulates tight junctions), inflammatory response to bacterial endotoxins (antibodies to endotoxins and sCD14-a soluble form of the CD14 protein that modulates inflammation triggered by lipopolysaccharides), and acute intestinal epithelial damage (I-FABP, released upon enterocyte injury). Studies investigating suicidality and related biomarkers were limited in number and scope, preventing definitive conclusions. Overall, these findings suggest that biomarkers of gut permeability represent a promising area for further investigation in both psychiatric and forensic pathology. They may have practical applications, such as supporting diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making in clinical settings and providing pathologists with additional information to help determine the manner of death in forensic investigations.

## 126. Xiaoyao San ameliorates maternal inflammation-induced neurobehavioral deficits by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in offspring.

BACKGROUND: XiaoYao San (XYS), a classical Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. However, its therapeutic potential against maternal immune activation (MIA)-induced neurobehavioral impairments remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of XYS on MIA-related behavioral dysfunctions and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Using a poly (I:C)-induced MIA mouse model, we demonstrated that XYS effectively ameliorates autism spectrum disorder (ASD) related behavioral phenotypes. Mechanistic investigations revealed that XYS exerts its therapeutic effects through: (1) Attenuation of core behavioral deficits including enhanced social interaction and reduced repetitive behaviors; (2) Downregulation of intestinal amino acid transporters; (3) Restoration of cerebral glutamate-GABA balance via modulation of glutamine pathway; (4) Structural remodeling of gut microbiota with specific enrichment of Bacteroides spp. Notably, B. uniformis was identified as a key microbial mediator capable of recapitulating XYS-mediated neurophysiological improvements through metabolic regulation. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates XYS as a multi-target therapeutic agent that coordinately modulates gut microbial ecosystems, amino acid homeostasis, and neurotransmitter homeostasis. The findings provide novel insights into the gut-brain axis mechanisms of TCM formulations, offering a scientific foundation for developing microbiota-based intervention strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders.

## 127. Current status and trends in the study of intestinal flora in cognitive disorders: a bibliometric and visual analysis.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a decline in people's ability to think, learn, and remember, which has some impact on an individual's daily activities or social functioning. Microbial toxins and metabolites from dysregulated gut microbiota directly interact with the intestinal epithelium. This interaction triggers neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system, ultimately impairing cognitive function. It has been found that modulation of gut flora can be an effective intervention to improve cognitive dysfunction. This study is the first to summarize and outline the global research status and trends in this field from a bibliometric perspective, providing reference and guidance for future research in this field. METHODS: Based on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, Literature on gut flora and cognitive impairment published between 1999-2025 was searched. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software to analyze the data on countries, institutions, authors, journals, keywords, citations, and to generate visual maps. RESULTS: A total of 1,702 pieces of related literature were retrieved. The overall trend of publication is increasing. China has published the largest number of papers, and Huazhong University of Science & Technology and Kim, Dong-Hyun were the institutions and individuals with more publications. The most frequently cited journal is SCI REP-UK. The most frequent keywords are gut microbiota, followed by Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, Brain, oxidative stress and Inflammation. CONCLUSION: In recent years, the research application of gut flora in the treatment of cognitive impairment has made remarkable progress. Oxidative stress and inflammatory response have become the main research hotspots for gut flora to improve cognitive impairment in patients. The gut-brain axis plays an important role in the study of the mechanism of action. Short-chain fatty acids are the focus of research on gut microbial metabolism. Fecal microbial transplantation technology is increasingly being used as an emerging method for the application of intestinal flora. Modifying the gut flora by modifying diet and exercise may be an effective strategy to prevent and improve cognitive dysfunction in the future. Future studies may focus more on gender differences in the role of gut flora in the modulation of cognitive function.

## 128. Metal Dyshomeostasis as a Driver of Gut Pathology in Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Despite being classified as neurodevelopmental disorders, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in the association between autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and gut pathology. This comprehensive and systematic review explores a potential mechanism underlying gut pathology in ASDs, including alterations in gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, immune dysregulation, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Specifically, it delves into the role of toxic and essential metals and their interplay, affecting the development and function of the GI tract. The review also discusses the potential implications of this gut pathology in the development and management of ASDs. Studies have shown that heavy metal exposure, whether through environmental sources or dietary intake, can disrupt the delicate balance of trace elements in the gut. This disruption can adversely affect zinc homeostasis, potentially exacerbating gut pathology in individuals with ASDs. The impaired zinc absorption resulting from heavy metal exposure may contribute to the immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation observed in the gut of individuals with ASDs. By shedding light on the multifaceted nature of gut pathology, including the impact of metal dyshomeostasis as a non-genetic factor in ASD, this review underscores the significance of the gut-brain axis in the etiology and management of ASDs.

## 129. Microecologics and Exercise: Targeting the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis for Central Nervous System Disease Intervention.

The gut microbiota (GM) may play a crucial role in the development and progression of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Microecologics and exercise can influence the composition and function of GM, thereby exerting positive effects on the CNS. Combined interventions of exercise and microecologics are expected to more comprehensively and effectively address CNS diseases through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), potentially outperforming single interventions. However, there is currently a lack of relevant reviews on this topic. In this review, we examine the associations between changes in the microbiota and CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We also summarize studies on various types of microecologics (such as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics) and exercise in improving CNS disease symptoms. Although current individual studies on microecologics and exercise have achieved certain results, the mechanisms underlying their synergistic effects remain unclear. This review aims to explore the theoretical basis, potential mechanisms, and clinical application prospects of combined interventions of microecologics and exercise in improving CNS diseases through the MGBA, providing a scientific basis for the development of more comprehensive and effective therapeutic interventions.

## 130. Therapeutic targeting of the host-microbiota-immune axis: implications for precision health.

The human body functions as a complex ecosystem, hosting trillions of microbes that collectively form the microbiome, pivotal in immune system regulation. The host-microbe immunological axis maintains homeostasis and influences key physiological processes, including metabolism, epithelial integrity, and neural function. Recent advancements in microbiome-based therapeutics, including probiotics, prebiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, offer promising strategies for immune modulation. Microbial therapies leveraging microbial metabolites and engineered bacterial consortia are emerging as novel therapeutic strategies. However, significant challenges remain, including individual microbiome variability, the complexity of host-microbe interactions, and the need for precise mechanistic insights. This review comprehensively examines the host microbiota immunological interactions, elucidating its mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and the future directions of microbiome-based immunomodulation in human health. It will also critically evaluate challenges, limitations, and future directions for microbiome-based precision medicine.

## 131. Radiation-induced injury and the gut microbiota: insights from a microbial perspective.

Although radiotherapy is the second most effective cancer treatment, radiation injuries limit its use. About 80% of abdominal-pelvic radiotherapy patients develop acute radiation enteritis, with 20% discontinuing radiotherapy. The lack of effective mitigation measures restricts its clinical application. Recent studies have proposed gut microbiota as a potential biomarker for radiation injuries. However, the interaction between gut microbiota and radiation injuries remains poorly understood. This review summarizes two forms of interaction between gut microbiota and radiation injuries based on the location of the radiation field. One type of interaction, referred to as "direct interaction," involves changes in the diversity and composition of gut microbiota, alterations in microbiota-derived metabolites, disruption of the intestinal barrier, activation of inflammatory responses within the intestine, and involvement of the host's immune system. The second form, called "indirect interaction," includes the influence of the gut microbiota on various body systems, such as gut microbiota-brain axis, gut microbiota-cardiopulmonary axis, and gut microbiota-oral axis. Additionally, we examine promising interventions aimed at reshaping the gut microbiota, including the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. The interaction between radiation injuries and gut microbiota is more complex than previously understood. Therefore, further clarification of the underlying mechanisms will facilitate the application of gut microbiota in preventing and alleviating radiation injuries.

## 132. Bidirectional Interplay Among Non-Coding RNAs, the Microbiome, and the Host During Development and Diseases.

It is widely known that the dysregulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome play significant roles in host development and the progression of various diseases. Emerging evidence has highlighted the bidirectional interplay between ncRNAs and the gut microbiome. This article aims to review the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between ncRNAs, especially microRNA (miRNA), and the gut microbiome in the context of development and diseases, such as colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, neurological disorders, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Ultimately, this review seeks to provide a foundation for exploring the potential roles of ncRNAs and gut microbiome interactions as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for clinical diagnosis and treatment, such as ncRNA mimics, antisense oligonucleotides, and small-molecule compounds, as well as probiotics, prebiotics, and diets.

## 133. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs) May Mediate the Neuroactive Effects of Probiotic Metabolites: An In Silico Approach.

It is well established that the gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. This axis, critical in maintaining overall homeostasis, is regulated at the neuronal, endocrine, and immunological levels, all of which may be influenced by the gut microbiota (GM). Therefore, dysbiosis or disruption in the GM may have serious consequences including neuroinflammation due to overactivation of the immune system. Strategies to reestablish GM integrity via use of probiotics are being pursued as novel therapeutic intervention in a variety of central and peripheral diseases. The mechanisms leading to dysbiosis or efficacy of probiotics, however, are not fully evident. Here, we performed computational analysis on two major probiotics, namely Lactobacillus Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (formerly named Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. rhamnosus GG) and Bifidobacterium animalis spp. lactis (B. lactis or B. animalis) to not only shed some light on their mechanism(s) of action but also to identify potential molecular targets for novel probiotics. Using the PubMed web page and BioCyc Database Collection platform we specifically analyzed proteins affected by metabolites of these bacteria. Our results indicate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptor proteins that are involved in regulation of inflammation are key mediators of the neuroactive effect of probiotics.

## 134. Targeting the Gut-Brain Axis with Plant-Derived Essential Oils: Phytocannabinoids and Beyond.

Background: The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex bidirectional communication system that links the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Essential oils (EOs) have emerged as promising natural compounds capable of modulating this axis. Methods: A comprehensive analysis of the recent literature was conducted, focusing on studies investigating the effects of EOs on the GBA. Particular attention was given to the endocannabinoid system, the role of cannabis-derived EOs, and other plant-based EOs with potential neuroprotective and gut microbiota-modulating effects. Results: Among the EOs analyzed, cannabis essential oil (CEO) gained attention for its interaction with cannabinoid receptors (CBR1 and CBR2), modulating gut motility, immune responses, and neurotransmission. While acute administration of the CEO reduces inflammation and gut permeability, chronic use has been associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition, potentially impairing cognitive function. Other EOs, such as those from rosemary, lavender, eucalyptus, and oregano, demonstrated effects on neurotransmitter modulation, gut microbiota balance, and neuroinflammation, supporting their potential therapeutic applications in GBA-related disorders. Conclusions: EOs demonstrate promising potential in modulating the GBA through mechanisms including neurotransmitter regulation, gut microbiota modulation, and anti-inflammatory activity. At the same time, phytocannabinoids offer therapeutic value; their long-term use warrants caution due to potential impacts on microbiota. Future research should aim to identify EO-based interventions that can synergistically restore GBA homeostasis and mitigate neurodegenerative and gastrointestinal disorders.

## 135. Berberine Alleviates Kainic Acid-Induced Acute Epileptic Seizures in Mice via Reshaping Gut Microbiota-Associated Lipid Metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Berberine (BBR) has been reported to mitigate epileptic seizures. However, the potential mechanism of its anti-seizure effect remains uncharacterized. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of BBR on acute epileptic seizures induced by kainic acid (KA) in mice and further explore its mechanism of action in the aspect of analysis of gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protective effect of BBR against acute epileptic seizures was assessed via Racine score and Nissl training. Alterations of gut microbiota and metabolites in seizure mice after BBR treatment were analyzed through 16S sequencing and lipidomics, respectively. RESULTS: Our results showed that the BBR remarkably alleviated acute epileptic seizures and hippocampal neuron damage in KA-induced mice. The analysis of gut microbiota indicated that BBR reduced the acute epileptic seizures in KA-induced mice by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Alloprevotella, regulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Results of lipidomics also identified 21 candidate metabolites in the colon and hippocampus possibly involved in the protective effect of BBR against acute seizures. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that BBR exerts neuroprotection against KA-induced epileptic seizures through remodeling gut microbiota-associated lipid metabolism in the colon and hippocampus. BBR may serve as a valuable candidate drug for curing patients with epilepsy.

## 136. Crosstalk Among Gut Microbiota, Fecal Metabolites, and Amygdala Neuropathology Genes After Ginger Polyphenol Administration in Female Rats with Neuropathic Pain: Evidence for Microbiota-Gut-Brain Connection.

Objectives. The relationships among neuropathic pain, gut microbiota, microbiome-derived metabolites, and neuropathology have received increasing attention. This study examined the effects of two dosages of gingerol-enriched ginger (GEG) on mechanical hypersensitivity, anxiety-like behavior, gut microbiome composition and its metabolites, and neuropathology markers in female rats in the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain. Methods. Forty female rats were assigned to 4 groups: sham-vehicle, SNL-vehicle, SNL+GEG at 200 mg/kg BW, and SNL+GEG at 600 mg/kg BW via oral gavage. All animals were given an AIN-93G diet for 5 weeks. Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed by the von Frey test. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed by the open field test. Fecal microbiota composition and metabolites were determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and GC-MS, respectively. Neuropathology gene expression profiling of the amygdala was assessed by an nCounter(®) Neuropathology pathway panel. Results. Both GEG-treated groups showed decreased mechanical hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behavior in the SNL model. Gut microbiome diversity in both GEG groups was decreased compared with untreated SNL rats. In the SNL model, phyla such as Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobiota were decreased. Compared with the untreated SNL group, both GEG groups exhibited increased abundance of the phyla Bacteroidota (i.e., Rikenella, Alistipes, Muribaculaceae, Odoribacter), Firmicutes (i.e., UBA1819, Ruminococcaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Roseburia), and Verrucomicrobiota (i.e., Victivallis). GEG groups had higher levels of nine hydrophilic positive metabolites [val-glu, urocanic acid, oxazolidinone, L-threonine, L-norleucine, indole, imino-tryptophan, 2,3-octadiene-5,7-diyn-1-ol, and (2E)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) acrylaldehyde] and two hydrophilic negative metabolites [methylmalonic acid and metaphosphoric acid], as well as lower levels of five hydrophilic metabolites [xanthine, N-acetylmuramic acid, doxaprost, adenine, and 1-myristoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine]. Among the 770 neuropathology genes, 1 gene (PLA2G4A) was upregulated and 2 genes (CDK5R1 and SHH) were downregulated in SNL rats. GEG caused the upregulation of nine genes (APC, CCNH, EFNA5, GRN, HEXB, ITPR1, PCSK2, TAF9, and WFS1) and downregulation of three genes (AVP, C4A, and TSPO) in the amygdala. Conclusions. GEG supplementation mitigated pain-associated behaviors in female rats with neuropathic pain, in part by reversing the molecular neuropathology signature of the amygdala. This was associated with changes in the gut microbiome composition and fecal metabolites, which could play a role in mediating the effects of GEG on neuropathic pain.

## 137. Intestinal Lactobacillus johnsonii protects against neuroangiostrongyliasis in BALB/c mice through modulation of immune response.

Neuroangiostrongyliasis is characterized by eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with a robust onset of severe neurological symptoms, by which immunological factors and peripheral metabolites have been postulated to affect the course of the disease. The gut-brain axis provides a bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system, and therefore, understanding the gut microbiome may provide us with a deeper insight into the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified an increase in the abundance of different Lactobacillus species in Angiostrongylus cantonensis-infected mice, which was correlated to the disease severity. However, attempts to inoculate L. johnsonii into A. cantonensis-infected mice surprisingly revealed an improvement in neuroinflammation and prolonged survival. RNA sequencing suggested an immune-modulatory effect of L. johnsonii, which was confirmed by ELISA, showing increased levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and MCP-1 in the brain. Nevertheless, L. johnsonii-associated improvements were not associated with microbiome-related metabolites, as UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed no change in short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bile acids. Our results suggest that while intestinal L. johnsonii appears to be linked to the progression of neuroangiostrongyliasis, these bacteria are likely attempting to modulate the dysregulated immune response to combat the disease. This is one of the first studies to investigate the gut microbiome in mice with A. cantonensis infection, which extends our knowledge from the microbiome-point-of-view of the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis and how the body defends against A. cantonensis. This work also extends to possible treatment approaches using L. johnsonii as probiotics.

## 138. Gut-Brain Axis-Based Polygala Tenuifolia and Magnolia Officinalis Improve D-gal-Induced Cognitive Impairment in Mice Through cAMP and NF-κB Signaling Pathways.

PURPOSE: Polygala tenuifolia Willd. (PT) is commonly used to address cognitive impairment (CI), while Magnolia officinalis Rehd. et Wils (MO) is often prescribed for gastrointestinal issues as well as CI. This study seeks to explore the impacts and mechanisms behind the combined therapy of PT and MO (PM) in treating CI, based on the concept of the gut-brain axis. METHODS: The characteristic components of PT, MO, and PM were identified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A mouse model was established by D-gal induction, and the effects of PT, MO, and PM on CI were evaluated through behavioral tests, pathological staining, and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Subsequently, network pharmacology was used to analyze the potential mechanisms by which PM improves CI, followed by validation through Western blotting (WB), traditional Chinese medicine (TEM), Immunofluorescence (IF), and 16S rRNA. RESULTS: PT, MO, and PM can each alleviate cognitive decline and neuropathological damage in D-gal mice to varying degrees, reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, LPS) in serum or hippocampal tissue, and increase SOD and GSH levels. Network pharmacology analysis and molecular experiments confirmed that PM upregulates the expression of tight junction s (TJs), enhances the expression of proteins in the cAMP pathway, and inhibits p-NF-κB-p65 expression. PM reverses D-gal-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, increases the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria, and decreases the abundance of LPS-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: PM alleviates CI by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, protecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and intestinal barrier, inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, activating the cAMP pathway, and regulating gut microbiota.

## 139. Altered cognitive function in obese patients: relationship to gut flora.

Obesity is a risk factor for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which are leading causes of death and disability. Today, China has the largest number of overweight and obese people, imposing a heavy burden on China's healthcare system. Obesity adversely affects the central nervous system (CNS), especially cognitive functions such as executive power, working memory, learning, and so on. The gradual increase in adult obesity rates has been accompanied by a increase in childhood obesity rates. In the past two decades, the obesity rate among children under 5 years of age has increased from 32 to 42 million. If childhood obesity is not intervened in the early years, it will continue into adulthood and remain there for life. Among the potential causative factors, early lifestyle may influence the composition of the gut flora in childhood obesity, such as the rate and intake of high-energy foods, low levels of physical activity, may persist into adulthood, thus, early lifestyle interventions may improve the composition of the gut flora in obese children. Adipose Axis plays an important role in the development of obesity. Adipose tissue is characterized by increased expression of nucleoside diphosphate-linked molecule X-type motif 2 (NUDT2), amphiphilic protein AMPH genes, which encode proteins that all play important roles in the CNS. NUDT2 is associated with intellectual disability. Furthermore, amphiphysin (AMPH) is involved in glutamatergic signaling, ganglionic synapse development, and maturation, which is associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). All of the above studies show that obesity is closely related to cognitive decline in patients. Animal experiments have confirmed that obesity causes changes in cognitive function. For example, high-fat diets rich in long- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids may adversely affect cognitive function in obese mice. This process may be attributed to the Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA)-rich high-fat diet (HFD) activating enterocyte TLR signaling, especially TLR-2 and TLR-4, altering the downstream MyD88-4 signaling, thereby impacting the downstream MyD88-NF-κB signaling cascade and up-regulating the levels of pro-inflammatory factors and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These changes result in the loss of integrity of the intestinal mucosa and cause an imbalance in the internal environment. Obesity may lead to the disruption of the intestinal flora and damage the intestinal barrier function, causing intestinal flora dysbiosis. In recent years, a growing number of studies have investigated the relationship between obesity and the intestinal flora. For example, high-fat and high-sugar diets have been found to lead to the thinning of the mucus layer of the colon, a decrease in the number of tight junction proteins, and an increase in intestinal permeability in mice. Such changes alter the composition of intestinal microorganisms, allow endotoxins into the blood circulation, and induce neuroinflammation and brain damage. Therefore, obesity affects cognitive function and is even hereditary. This paper reviews the obesity-induced cognitive dysfunction, the underlying mechanisms, the research progress of intestinal flora dysregulation in obese patients, the relationship between intestinal flora and cognitive function changes, and the research progress on intestinal flora dysregulation in obese patients. We want to regulate the internal environment of obese patients from the perspective of intestinal flora, improving the cognitive function of obese patients, and prevent obesity-induced changes in related neurological functions.

## 140. The Interplay Between Exosomes and Gut Microbiota in Neuroinflammation: A New Frontier in Alzheimer's Disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β, the hyperphosphorylation of tau, and persistent neuroinflammation. However, these hallmarks alone do not fully capture the intricacies of AD pathology, thus necessitating the investigation of emerging mechanisms and innovative tools. Exosomes (nanoscale vesicles involved in cell communication and immune modulation) have emerged as pivotal cellular vehicles due to their dual role-both in the propagation of pathological proteins and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, these vesicles have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the mediation of the effects of microbiota-derived metabolites and the reflection of systemic influences such as dysbiosis, thereby establishing a link between the gut-brain axis and the progression of AD. A comprehensive narrative literature review was conducted using the following databases: ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, Web of Science, Medline, and PubMed, covering studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to select research addressing exosomal biogenesis, their functional and diagnosis role, their therapeutic potential, and the emerging evidence on microbiota-exosome interplay in Alzheimer's disease. Exosomes have been identified as integral mediators of intercellular communication, reflecting the molecular state of the central nervous system. These particles have been shown to promote the propagation of pathological proteins, modulate neuroinflammatory responses, and serve as non-invasive biomarkers due to their detectability in peripheral fluids. Advances in exosomal engineering and microbiome-based interventions underscore the potential for targeting systemic and CNS-specific mechanisms to develop integrative therapies for AD. Exosomes present a promising approach for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, methodological challenges and ongoing controversies, including those related to the influence of systemic factors such as dysbiosis, necessitate multidisciplinary research to optimize and standardize these strategies.

## 141. Nutrition and Neuroinflammation: Are Middle-Aged Women in the Red Zone?

Women exhibit unique vulnerabilities in health, especially regarding mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Biological, hormonal, and metabolic differences contribute to sex-specific risks that remain underrepresented in clinical studies. Diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are more prevalent in women and may be influenced by hormonal transitions, particularly during menopause. Chronic low-grade inflammation is emerging as a shared mechanism underlying both conditions, and this inflammatory state can be worsened by dietary habits. During menopause, mood and sleep disturbances can influence dietary behavior, leading to enhanced snacking and consumption of high-glycemic and comfort foods. Such foods, low in nutritional value, promote weight gain and elevated inflammatory markers. Their consumption combined (or not) with a preexisting Western diet pattern-already linked to inflammation-could reinforce systemic inflammation involving the gut-brain axis. Moreover, the symptoms "per se" could act on inflammation as well. Peripheral inflammation may cross the blood-brain barrier, sustaining mood disorders and promoting neurodegenerative changes. Finally, MDD and AD are both associated with conditions such as obesity and diabetes, which occur more frequently in women. The review highlights how menopause-related changes in mood, sleep, and diet may heighten susceptibility to mental and neurodegenerative diseases.

## 142. Unraveling Spinal Cord Injury Nutrition: Effects of Diet on the Host and Microbiome.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to severe neurological dysfunction with significant nutritional alterations. These alterations are closely associated with gut dysbiosis and neurogenic gut dysfunction after SCI, creating complex interactions that further exacerbate metabolic disturbances and impede neurological recovery. In the context of SCI, diet not only fulfills basic nutritional needs but also serves as an important therapeutic tool to modulate these interactions. This review provides a broad overview of existing research findings, analyzes the impact of existing dietary interventions on SCI, and attempts to clarify the complex relationship between diet and host and gut microbiota. We hope to provide a clear direction for future research and a scientific basis for the development of personalized dietary interventions to improve the nutritional status of patients with SCI, reduce the incidence of complications such as metabolic disorders, and promote the recovery of neurological function and overall quality of life of patients with SCI.

## 143. Phage-Microbiota Crosstalk: Implications for Central Nervous System Disorders.

The gut microbiota constitutes a complex community of microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa) within the intestinal tract. Over the years, an increasing number of studies have highlighted the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), a relationship commonly referred to as the “microbiota–gut–brain axis”. In particular, the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the brain has been associated with the pathogenesis and progression of various CNS disorders. Phages, or bacteriophages, viruses that specifically infect bacteria, constitute the most abundant viral component within the gut microbiota. However, despite their abundance and significance in the gut microbial community, studies exploring the relationship between phages and the CNS remain surprisingly limited. This review examines the biological interplay between gut-resident phages and the CNS. Furthermore, we discuss the current literature linking phages to CNS-related pathologies.

## 144. Neuroinflammation: Mechanisms, Dual Roles, and Therapeutic Strategies in Neurological Disorders.

Neuroinflammation represents a fundamental component in the development and progression of a wide range of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric conditions, and cerebral injuries. This review examines the complex mechanisms underlying neuroinflammatory responses, with a focus on the interactions between glial cells and neurons. The dualistic role of neuroinflammation is further investigated, highlighting its ability to promote neuroprotection in acute phases while also contributing to neuronal injury and degeneration during chronic activation. This review also considers innovative therapeutic approaches designed to target neuroinflammatory processes, like drug-based treatments and immune-modulating therapies. A thorough understanding of the regulatory balance within neuroinflammatory networks is essential for the development of effective treatments for several neurological pathologies. Finally, this review provides an integrative summary of current evidence and highlights emerging directions in neuroinflammation research.

## 145. Advances in gut-lung axis research: clinical perspectives on pneumonia prevention and treatment.

In recent years, the study of the interaction between gut microbiota and distant organs such as the heart, lungs, brain, and liver has become a hot topic in the field of gut microbiology. With a deeper understanding of its immune regulation and mechanisms of action, these findings have increasingly highlighted their guiding value in clinical practice. The gut is not only the largest digestive organ in the human body but also the habitat for most microorganisms. Imbalances in gut microbial communities have been associated with various lung diseases, such as allergic asthma and cystic fibrosis. Furthermore, gut microbial communities have significant impacts on metabolic function and immune responses. Their metabolites not only regulate gastrointestinal immune systems but may also affect distant organs such as the lungs and brain. As one of the most common types of respiratory system diseases worldwide, pulmonary infections have high morbidity and mortality rates. Pulmonary infections caused by immune dysfunction can lead to gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea, further resulting in imbalances within complex interactions that are associated with abnormal manifestations under disequilibrium conditions. Meanwhile, clinical interventions can significantly modulate the composition of gut microbiota, and alteration in gut microbiota may subsequently indicate susceptibility to pulmonary infections and even contribute to the prevention or regulation of their progression. This review delves into the interaction between gut microbiota and pulmonary infections, elucidating the latest advancements in gut-lung axis research and providing a fresh perspective for the treatment and prevention of pneumonia.

## 146. Can We Modulate Our Second Brain and Its Metabolites to Change Our Mood? A Systematic Review on Efficacy, Mechanisms, and Future Directions of "Psychobiotics".

Psychobiotics, live microorganisms that provide mental health by interacting with the gut microbiota, are emerging as a promising therapeutic option for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Their effectiveness in addressing conditions such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, stress, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and eating disorders were examined through a comprehensive analysis of existing studies up to the first half of 2024, based on data from reliable electronic databases. We found that psychobiotics can significantly reduce symptoms of various psychiatric disorders by influencing neurotransmitter levels, regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and improving gut barrier function through short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites. However, several limitations were identified, including inconsistent study methodologies, small sample sizes, and a lack of data on long-term safety. Addressing these limitations through rigorous research is essential for establishing standardized protocols and fully confirming the therapeutic potential of psychobiotics. In conclusion, psychobiotics show great promise as complementary treatments for mental health conditions, but continued research is necessary to refine their application and integrate them into clinical practice effectively.

## 147. Neuroinflammation-A Crucial Factor in the Pathophysiology of Depression-A Comprehensive Review.

Depression is a multifactorial psychiatric condition with complex pathophysiology, increasingly linked to neuroinflammatory processes. The present review explores the role of neuroinflammation in depression, focusing on glial cell activation, cytokine signaling, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and disruptions in neurotransmitter systems. The article highlights how inflammatory mediators influence brain regions implicated in mood regulation, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. The review further discusses the involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, oxidative stress, and the kynurenine pathway, providing mechanistic insights into how chronic inflammation may underlie emotional and cognitive symptoms of depression. The bidirectional relationship between inflammation and depressive symptoms is emphasized, along with the role of peripheral immune responses and systemic stress. By integrating molecular, cellular, and neuroendocrine perspectives, this review supports the growing field of immunopsychiatry and lays the foundation for novel diagnostic biomarkers and anti-inflammatory treatment approaches in depression. Further research in this field holds promise for developing more effective and personalized interventions for individuals suffering from depression.

## 148. Pectin-Zein-IPA nanoparticles promote functional recovery and alleviate neuroinflammation after spinal cord injury.

INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs the balance of gut microbiomes, which further aggravates inflammation in the injured areas and inhibits axonal regeneration. The intestinal microbiome plays an important role in SCI and regulating intestinal microbiome promotes SCI repair. However, current studies have shown that indole-3 propionate (IPA), a metabolite of gut bacteria, can promote axonal regeneration. However, the short half-life of IPA limits its effectiveness. Gut microbiota plays a role in the progression of SCI, but the studies about diet regulates intestinal flora metabolites to improve SCI are still limited and lack guiding significance. RESULTS: The results showed that Pectin-Zein-IPA NPs treatment improves motor function recovery, inhibits the activation of oxidative stress, enhances axonal regeneration and activates AKT/Nrf-2 signaling pathway following SCI. Further analysis showed that Pec-Zein-IPA NPs treatment reduced the intestinal flora metabolite accumulation of L-methionine, and alleviated neuroinflammation by improving autophagy and inhibiting pyroptosis. Pec-Zein-IPA may reduced neuroinflammation after SCI by decreasing the abundance of Clostridia(-)UCG-014, Clostridia(-)vadinBB60(-)group, Shewanella (positively correlated with L-Methionine) and increasing the abundance of Parasutterella (negatively correlated with L-Methionine). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a strategy for oral drug research in SCI. The results suggest that Pectin-Zein-IPA NPs have potential advantages for treatment and management of SCI. Reducing L-methionine intake may help reduce neuroinflammation after SCI.

## 149. Impact of Diquat on the Intestinal Health and the Composition and Function of the Gut Microbiome.

Diquat (DQ) is extensively utilized as a herbicide in farming, and its intake can result in serious systemic toxicity due to its induction of oxidative stress (OS) and disruption of intestinal homeostasis. The gastrointestinal tract is one of the first systems exposed to DQ, and damage to this system can influence the general health of the host. Our review summarizes the toxic effects of DQ on the intestinal barrier integrity, gut microbiome, and microbial metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids [SCFAs], bile acids). By elucidating the mechanisms linking DQ-induced OS to gut dysbiosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, our work provides critical insights into novel therapeutic strategies, including probiotics, antioxidants (e.g., hydroxytyrosol, curcumin), and selenium nanoparticles. These findings address a pressing gap in understanding environmental toxin-related gut pathology and offer potential interventions to mitigate systemic oxidative damage.

## 150. Role of the Intestinal Microbiota in the Molecular Pathogenesis of Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes.

The role of the intestinal microbiota and its influence on neurodegenerative disorders has recently been extensively explored, especially in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). In particular, its role in immunomodulation, impact on inflammation, and participation in the gut-brain axis are under ongoing investigations. Recent studies have revealed new data that could be important for exploring the neurodegeneration mechanisms connected with the gut microbiota, potentially leading to the development of new methods of treatment. In this review, the potential roles of the gut microbiota in future disease-modifying therapies were discussed and the properties of the intestinal microbiota-including its impacts on metabolism and short-chain fatty acids and vitamins-were summarized, with a particular focus on atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. This review focused on a detailed description of the numerous mechanisms through which the microbiota influences neurodegenerative processes. This review explored potentially important connections between the gut microbiota and the evolution and progression of atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. Finally, a description of recently derived results regarding the microbiota alterations in atypical Parkinsonian syndromes in comparison with results previously described in PD was also included.

## 151. OVA-Induced Food Allergy Leads to Neurobehavioral Changes in Mice and the Potential Role of Gut Microbiota and Metabolites Dysbiosis.

The neurobehavioral changes in food allergy mice have not been comprehensively studied, and the mechanism underlying them remains unclear. Our study aims to fully investigate neurobehavioral changes in OVA (ovalbumin)-sensitized food allergy mice and explore the potential mechanism via the gut microbiota-brain axis. We established the food allergy mouse (C57BL/6J male) model with OVA, evaluating the anaphylactic symptoms and the levels of Th2 signature cytokine and allergy-related antibodies in serum. Using behavioral tests, we measured anxiety, depression, social behavior, repetitive behavior, attention, and spatial memory in control and OVA mice. In addition, we analyzed the prefrontal cortex for measuring inflammation-related indicators and gathered serum for untargeted metabolomics analysis and feces for 16S rDNA sequencing. OVA mice exhibited anaphylactic symptoms and significantly elevated serum IgE and Th2 signature cytokine levels. In addition to anxiety-like, depression-like, and repetitive behaviors, OVA mice also displayed less social interest and damaged attention. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels and the activation of microglia in the prefrontal cortex of OVA mice were significantly increased, which might explain the neuronal damage. Using multi-omics technology, amino acid metabolism disruption, particularly carboxylic acids and derivatives, was observed in OVA mice, which was remarkably correlated with the altered abundance of gut microbiota related to food allergy. Behaviors in OVA-induced food allergy mice were extensively impaired. The disruption of amino acid metabolism associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis in OVA mice might play a pivotal role in impairing neural immune homeostasis and neuronal damage, which could be responsible for behavioral abnormalities.

## 152. Brain Neurotrophins and Plant Polyphenols: A Powerful Connection.

Neurodegenerative disorders, mental conditions, and cognitive decline represent significant challenges worldwide, with growing pieces of evidence implicating alterations in neurotrophin signaling as central to these diseases. Neurotrophins-such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-are indispensable for neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity, and their dysregulation is closely associated with various neuropathological situations. Similarly, dietary plant polyphenols, abundant in vegetables, fruits, wine, tea, and extra virgin olive oil, show powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic activities. This narrative review critically addresses the evolving body of evidence that links plant polyphenols and brain neurotrophins, emphasizing several molecular mechanisms by which polyphenols regulate and modulate neurotrophin signaling. Crucial pathways include mitigation of neuroinflammatory responses, activation of intracellular cascades such as the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), epigenetic modulation, and the diminution of oxidative stress. Together, these effects contribute to potentiated enhanced synaptic function, neuronal integrity, and better learning and memory processes. Moreover, this narrative review examines how polyphenol-induced upregulation of neurotrophins may alleviate conditions associated not only with neurodegeneration but also with addiction and mood disorders, suggesting extensive therapeutic approaches. Findings from clinical investigations and animal models are presented to sustain the neuroprotective role of polyphenol-rich diets. Lastly, future research directions are recommended, focusing on polyphenol bioavailability optimization, considering combinatory dietary stratagems, and proposing personalized nutritional interventions. This wide-ranging perspective highlights plant polyphenols as encouraging modulators of neurotrophin pathways and supports their inclusion in approaches aimed at promoting brain health and counteracting neurodegenerative decline.

## 153. Gut microbiota and metabolites are linked to disease progression in multiple sclerosis.

Progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with limited understanding of the biology associated with transition from relapsing to progressive disease. Intestinal microbes and metabolites are altered in MS, but relation to disease progression is largely unknown. We investigate microbiota and metabolites in subjects with stable MS, those who worsened, and in those with relapsing MS who became progressive over 2 years. We find that Eubacterium hallii, Butyricoccaceae, Blautia, and other short-chain fatty-acid-producing microbes have beneficial associations with worsening of disability, 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, cognition, and quality of life, while Alistipes is detrimentally associated. Global metabolomics identified serum and stool metabolites that are altered in progressive MS and in relapsing subjects who transitioned to progressive disease. Most fecal metabolites associated with disease progression are decreased, suggesting a deficiency of protective factors in the gut. Using a unique MS cohort, our findings identify gut microbiome and metabolite pathways influencing progressive MS.

## 154. The gut microbiota-oligodendrocyte axis: A promising pathway for modulating oligodendrocyte homeostasis and demyelination-associated disorders.

The bidirectional regulation between the gut microbiota and brain, known as gut-brain axis, has received significant attention. The myelin sheath, produced by oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells, is essential for efficient nervous signal transmission and the maintenance of brain function. Growing evidence shows that both oligodendrogenesis and myelination are modulated by gut microbiota and its metabolites, and when dysbiosis occurs, changes in the microbiota composition and/or associated metabolites may impact developmental myelination and the occurrence of neurodevelopmental disabilities. Although the link between the microbiota and demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis has been extensively studied, our knowledge about the role of the microbiota in other myelin-related disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases, is limited. Mechanistically, the microbiota-oligodendrocyte axis is primarily mediated by factors such as inflammation, the vagus nerve, endocrine hormones, and microbiota metabolites as evidenced by metagenomics, metabolomics, vagotomy, and morphological and molecular approaches. Treatments targeting this axis include probiotics, prebiotics, microbial metabolites, herbal bioactive compounds, and specific dietary management. In addition to the commonly used approaches, viral vector-mediated tracing and gene manipulation, integrated multiomics and multicenter clinical trials will greatly promote the mechanistic and interventional studies and ultimately, the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies against gut-oligodendrocyte axis-mediated brain impairments. Interestingly, recent findings showed that microbiota dysbiosis can be induced by hippocampal myelin damage and is reversible by myelin-targeted drugs, which provides new insights into understanding how hippocampus-based functional impairment (such as in neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease) regulates the peripheral homeostasis of microbiota and associated systemic disorders.

## 155. PICRUSt2 Analysis of Fecal Microbiome Associated With a Murine Model of Multiple Sclerosis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Approximately 2–3 million people globally are believed to have MS. There is growing interest in the mechanistic link between MS and gut microbiome composition. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a murine model of inflammatory demyelination of the CNS commonly used to investigate the pathology of MS in relation to the microbiome. Previous research has shown that EAE affects the gut microbiome, and the improvement of EAE can promote microbiome homeostasis. Microbiome homeostasis is crucial for host health, as it contributes to immune regulation and produces bioavailable metabolic products in the digestive tract. Several factors, including diet, genetics, and environment, influence microbiome homeostasis apart from disease state. Our lab previously demonstrated that mice of the same genetic line, sourced from different manufacturers, exhibit differences in microbiome composition despite being housed under similar conditions. Furthermore, these mice showed variations in EAE progression and severity, indicating that differences in the microbiome may contribute to the discrepancies in EAE. Here, we employ PICRUSt2 to estimate functional differences in the microbiomes of EAE mice from various sources at key time points during the EAE disease course. The reanalysis of our microbiome data reveals distinct differences in predicted gene expression of microbiomes that are disproportionately related to the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and other metabolites. Our findings support previous observations regarding microbiome alterations in the context of EAE and suggest that evaluating microbiome dynamics would benefit from both taxonomic assessment and metabolic activity, allowing for more effective and comprehensive research strategies.

## 156. Specific Bacterial Taxa and Their Metabolite, DHPS, May Be Linked to Gut Dyshomeostasis in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

Background: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are multifactorial disorders frequently associated with gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: Using untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and 16S sequencing of human stool, we investigated bacterial and metabolic dyshomeostasis in the gut microbiome associated with early disease stages across three NDDs-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD)-and healthy controls (HC). Results: We discovered a previously unrecognized link between a microbial-derived metabolite with an unknown role in human physiology, 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), and gut dysbiosis in NDDs. DHPS was downregulated in AD, ALS, and PD, while bacteria involved in DHPS metabolism, Eubacterium and Desulfovibrio, were increased in all disease cohorts. Additionally, select taxa within the Clostridia class had strong negative correlations to DHPS, suggesting a potential role in DHPS metabolism. A catabolic product of DHPS is hydrogen sulfide, and when in excess, it is known to promote inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and gut dysbiosis, known hallmarks of NDDs. Conclusions: These findings suggest that cryptic sulfur metabolism via DHPS is a potential missing link in our current understanding of gut dysbiosis associated with NDD onset and progression. As this was a hypothesis generating study, more work is needed to elucidate the role of DHPS in gut dysbiosis and neurodegenerative diseases.

## 157. Breaking the Cycle: Can Vitamin D Bridge the Gap Between Gut Microbiota and Immune Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis?

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease with autoimmune and neurodegenerative features that affect the nervous system. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as vitamin D deficiency and dysbiosis activating a pro-inflammatory response, have a role in the etiology of the disease. In this context, the interactions of vitamin D with the gut microbiota and immune system have attracted attention in recent years. Vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) modulates the immune response by binding to the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). This pathway supports the functions of regulatory T cells by suppressing the activity of T helper cells 1 and 17 (Th1 and Th17). In MS patients, dysbiosis is characterized by a decrease in microbial diversity, and an increase in pro-inflammatory species is observed when compared to healthy individuals. Vitamin D has protective effects on eubiosis via VDR in intestinal epithelial cells, also reducing intestinal permeability by regulating tight junction proteins. In this way, vitamin D may contribute to the prevention of systemic inflammation. Although the relationship between vitamin D and the immune system is well documented, studies that address the triad of vitamin D level, gut microbiota, and immune response in MS are still limited.

## 158. The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorder.

The gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in the physiology and pathology of the host. Microbiota communicate with different organs of the organism by synthesizing hormones and regulating body activity. The interaction of the central nervous system (CNS) and gut signaling pathways includes chemical, neural immune and endocrine routes. Alteration or dysbiosis in the gut microbiota leads to different gastrointestinal tract disorders that ultimately impact host physiology because of the abnormal microbial metabolites that stimulate and trigger different physiologic reactions in the host body. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to a change in the bidirectional relationship between the CNS and GM, which is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Increasing preclinical and clinical studies/evidence indicate that gut microbes are a possible susceptibility factor for the progression of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this review, we discuss the crucial connection between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, the signaling pathways of multiple biological systems and the contribution of gut microbiota-related neurological disorders.

## 159. Gut Microbiota as a Key Modulator of Chronic Disease: Implications for Diabetes, Autoimmunity, and Cancer.

The gut microbiota (GM) represents an intricate, dynamic, and complex ecosystem. It plays a key role in health and disease. The GM interacts with the host and modulates various physiological functions, including metabolism, immune regulation, and neurological function. This narrative review comprehensively analyses the role of the GM in the development and progression of three major chronic conditions, namely diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Using a structured literature search strategy across databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, relevant studies published between 2000 and 2025 were identified and analysed. This review highlights that dysbiosis contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of these chronic conditions. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), alterations in the GM are associated with systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and decreased microbial diversity. Similarly, in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), dysbiosis disrupts immune homeostasis, which in turn causes sustained inflammation and aberrant immune responses. Lastly, dysbiosis has been linked to the onset and progression of various gastrointestinal cancers through mechanisms including chronic inflammation and the production of carcinogenic metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications are being explored for their potential to restore microbial balance and improve clinical outcomes. In conclusion, this review highlights the GM's pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## 160. The Gut-Brain Axis: How Microbiota and Host Inflammasome Influence Brain Physiology and Pathology.

The human microbiota has a fundamental role in host physiology and pathology. Gut microbial alteration, also known as dysbiosis, is a condition associated not only with gastrointestinal disorders but also with diseases affecting other distal organs. Recently it became evident that the intestinal bacteria can affect the central nervous system (CNS) physiology and inflammation. The nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract are communicating through a bidirectional network of signaling pathways called the gut-brain axis, which consists of multiple connections, including the vagus nerve, the immune system, and bacterial metabolites and products. During dysbiosis, these pathways are dysregulated and associated with altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuroinflammation. However, numerous mechanisms behind the impact of the gut microbiota in neuro-development and -pathogenesis remain poorly understood. There are several immune pathways involved in CNS homeostasis and inflammation. Among those, the inflammasome pathway has been linked to neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, but also anxiety and depressive-like disorders. The inflammasome complex assembles upon cell activation due to exposure to microbes, danger signals, or stress and lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β and interleukin-18) and to pyroptosis. Evidences suggest that there is a reciprocal influence of microbiota and inflammasome activation in the brain. However, how this influence is precisely working is yet to be discovered. Herein, we discuss the status of the knowledge and the open questions in the field focusing on the function of intestinal microbial metabolites or products on CNS cells during healthy and inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and also neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, we focus on the innate inflammasome pathway as immune mechanism that can be involved in several of these conditions, upon exposure to certain microbes.

## 161. Patients with periodontitis exhibit persistent dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and distinct serum metabolome.

OBJECTIVES: Animal studies suggest that periodontopathic bacteria induce gut dysbiosis and related pathology, possibly connecting periodontitis to non-oral diseases. However, the effects on the gut ecosystem in periodontitis patients are not fully understood. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the salivary and gut microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing in periodontitis patients before and after treatment, comparing them to healthy participants. Serum metabolites were also analyzed. RESULTS: Periodontitis patients showed high alpha diversity in both salivary and gut microbiota with a strong correlation. Significant differences were also observed in the gut microbiota composition between patients before treatment and healthy participants, irrespective of the ectopic colonization of periodontitis-associated bacteria in the gut. Co-abundance group analysis demonstrated that the gut microbiota of healthy participants was enriched with short-chain fatty acid producers. Changes in the gut microbiota coincided with alterations in the serum metabolite profile. While periodontal therapy improved salivary microbiota, it did not significantly affect gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Gut dysbiosis of periodontitis patients may impact systemic metabolite profiles. Given that periodontal therapy alone did not substantially improve the gut microbiota, adjunctive strategies targeting the gut microbiome may be effective in reducing the risk of periodontitis-associated diseases.

## 162. The influence of the gut microbiota on B cells in autoimmune diseases.

Mounting evidence shows that gut microbiota communities and the human immune system coexist and influence each other, and there are a number of reports of a correlation between specific changes in gut microbiota and the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. B lymphocytes play a central role in the regulation of both gut microbiota communities and in autoimmune diseases. Here, we summarize evidence of the influence of gut microbiota-B cell pathways on autoimmune diseases and how B cells regulate microorganisms, which provides mechanistic insights with relevance for identification of potential therapeutic targets and related fields.

## 163. Gut Microbiota and Their Metabolites: The Hidden Driver of Diabetic Nephropathy? Unveiling Gut Microbe's Role in DN.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a severe microvascular complication of diabetes with a complex pathogenesis. METHODS: Recent studies were reviewed to explore the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in DN development. RESULTS: Dysbiosis of gut bacteria contributes to pathological changes such as glomerular sclerosis and renal tubule injury. Microbial metabolites are involved in DN through immune and inflammatory pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the relationship between gut microbiota, its metabolites, and DN may offer potential implications for DN diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Translating this knowledge into clinical practice presents challenges and opportunities.

## 164. Dietary polyphenols represent a phytotherapeutic alternative for gut dysbiosis associated neurodegeneration: A systematic review.

Globally, neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease are common and growing causes of morbidity and mortality. Pathophysiology of this group of diseases encompasses various factors from oxidative stress to gut microbial dysbiosis. The study of the etiology and mechanisms of oxidative stress as well as gut dysbiosis-induced neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and Huntington's disease has recently received a lot of attention. Numerous studies lend credence to the notion that changes in the intestinal microbiota and enteric neuroimmune system have an impact on the initiation and severity of these diseases. The prebiotic role of polyphenols can influence the makeup of the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative disorders by modulating intracellular signalling pathways. Metabolites of polyphenols function directly as neurotransmitters by crossing the blood-brain barrier or indirectly via influencing the cerebrovascular system. This assessment aims to bring forth an interlink between the consumption of polyphenols biotransformed by gut microbiota which in turn modulate the gut microbial diversity and biochemical changes in the brain. This systematic review will further augment research towards the association of dietary polyphenols in the management of gut dysbiosis-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

## 165. Gut Microbiota and Tryptophan Metabolism as Therapeutic Targets for Spinal Cord Injury: Insights From Probiotic Treatment.

BACKGROUND: Probiotics have been demonstrated to repair spinal cord injuries (SCI) by improving gut microbiota dysbiosis; however, the specific mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects on SCI remain incompletely elucidated. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of probiotics and analyze the mechanisms of probiotic treatment for SCI through the gut-spinal cord axis. METHODS: A rat model of SCI was established to evaluate the therapeutic effects of probiotics. Fecal samples were analyzed to assess gut microbiota composition and metabolite profiles, while differential gene expression in spinal cord tissue was examined. RESULTS: Pathological assessments demonstrated that probiotic treatment facilitated structural restoration of the spinal cord tissue. Behavioral evaluations via the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) and inclined plane tests revealed significant improvements in locomotor recovery after SCI. Metagenomic sequencing showed that probiotics enhanced gut microbiota diversity, particularly enriching the relative abundance of Bacillota (formerly Firmicutes) and Clostridia. Metabolite profiling identified an enrichment of key tryptophan metabolites, including 3-Indoleacetonitrile, Xanthoxic acid, Serotonin, and Tryptophanol. Transcriptomic analysis identified 468 upregulated and 173 downregulated genes in spinal cord tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota, microbial metabolites and spinal cord gene expression were integrated to construct a "gut microbiota-tryptophan metabolites-signaling pathway network" using Cytoscape v.3.10.2. This network linked 19 microbial species (17 belonging to Bacillota and Clostridia, including seven Lactobacillus species) with tryptophan metabolites and downstream signaling pathways. Among these, tryptophan metabolites activated 17 genes predominantly involved in anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative processes. Protein-level validation confirmed the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of probiotics. CONCLUSION: The "Gut microbiota-tryptophan metabolites-signaling pathway network" offers novel therapeutic targets for SCI injury treatment. Probiotics exert their effects by modulating gut microbiota and enhancing tryptophan metabolism, thereby influencing multiple signaling pathways in the spinal cord that can lead to anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective outcomes.

## 166. The role of intestinal microbiota and its metabolites in the occurrence and intervention of obesity.

Obesity is a growing global health challenge influenced by genetic and environmental factors. With economic development, obesity rates continue to rise globally. Recent research highlights the critical role of gut microbiota in obesity pathogenesis, particularly through microbial metabolites affecting metabolism and energy homeostasis. Recent studies indicate that gut microbiota significantly influences obesity development through metabolic interactions, including the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Gut microbiota is involved in the metabolism of various nutrients such as glucose and lipids, and the change of gut microbiota leads to insulin resistance, adipose tissue accumulation and metabolic disorders, thus mediating the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases. For example, beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, which are in high abundance in animal intestinal tract, can prevent obesity by enhancing the intestinal barrier, improving insulin sensitivity and improving metabolic disorders. Many of these effects are mediated by metabolites produced by intestinal microbiota, such as short-chain fatty acids, which play an important role in preventing and treating obesity. In this research review, we used the PubMed database and Google Scholar and web of science to search for relevant literature within recent 20 years on the topic of microbes and microbial metabolites in relation to obesity. Key words used were obesity, metabolic diseases, gut microbiota, metabolic disorders, gut microbial metabolites to search for references. The purpose of this review article was to describe the current knowledge on the impact of gut microbiota and their metabolites on obesity, in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between gut microbiota and obesity for future clinical intervention and prevention of obesity.

## 167. The role of the tryptophan metabolites in gut microbiota-brain axis and potential treatments: a focus on ischemic stroke.

Gut microbiota disturbances can elevate the risk of stroke by contributing to cerebrovascular events. Particularly, the gut tryptophan (TRP) metabolite is an essential mediator of the gut-brain axis. This review highlights the role of TRP metabolism in stroke, the influence of intestinal microbiomes on stroke pathology via TRP metabolism, and the gut-brain axis interactions. Recent studies indicate that various bioactive molecules produced via TRP metabolism can regulate various neurological functions and interrupt stroke pathophysiology. Moreover, the relationship between gut TRP metabolism and stroke development has been verified. TRP metabolism involves three pathways: kynurenine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and indole, which potentially regulate post-stroke, may function as aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists to modify neuronal excitotoxicity, and offer crucial targets for stroke treatment. This suggests that modulating TRP metabolite levels through various methods can enhance the prognosis of central nervous system diseases and restore microbiota-gut-brain axis functions.

## 168. Tryptophan pathway profiling in multiple sclerosis patients treated with ocrelizumab.

INTRODUCTION: L-Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism is impaired across various chronic inflammatory pathologies, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Trp processing relies on three metabolic routes, namely Kynurenine, Serotonin and Indole pathways. The host microbiota significantly impacts Trp metabolism, primarily by being responsible for Indole metabolites production and secondarily by shaping both Kynurenine and Serotonin pathways. Pathological conditions and pharmaceutical treatments can elicit changes in microbial populations, leading to alterations in metabolites production and therefore determining rearrangements in host metabolism. Currently, no simultaneous exploration and comparison of all three Trp related metabolic routes has been performed in the context of MS patients before and after Ocrelizumab (OCR) treatment. METHODS: By performing mass spectrometry on plasma samples collected from healthy controls and MS patients before and six months after OCR treatment we provided a comparative investigation of Trp metabolomics profile. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our data points out to concurrent alterations of Trp-related pathways among both OCR treated and untreated MS patients. Furthermore, MS treated patients presented a pattern resembling health state for various metabolites across the pathways. The results reported in our research may contribute to unveiling new perspectives and understanding regarding MS pathogenetic mechanisms.

## 169. Exploring the Microbiome's Impact on Glioma and Brain Metastases: Insights into Development, Progression, and Treatment Response-A Scoping Review.

Background: The human microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease. Dysbiosis, an imbalance of microorganisms, has been implicated in cancer development and treatment response, including in primary brain tumors and brain metastases, through interactions mediated by the gut-brain axis. This scoping review synthesizes current evidence on the relationship between the human microbiome and brain tumors. Methods: A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted by an expert librarian, using controlled vocabulary and keywords. A targeted grey literature search in Google Scholar and clinical trial registries was also undertaken. Eligible studies included primary research involving human patients, or in vivo, or in vitro models of glioma or brain metastasis, with a focus on the microbiome's role in tumor development, treatment response, and outcomes. Results: Out of 584 citations screened, 40 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 24 articles and 16 conference abstracts. These included 12 human studies, 16 using mouse models, 7 combining both, and 5 employing large datasets or next-generation sequencing of tumor samples. Thirty-one studies focused on primary brain tumors, six on brain metastases, and three on both. Of the 20 studies examining dysbiosis in tumor development, 95% (n = 19) found an association with tumor growth. Additionally, 71.4% (n = 5/7) of studies reported that microbiome alterations influenced treatment efficacy. Conclusions: Although the role of the gut-brain axis in brain tumors is still emerging and is characterized by heterogeneity across studies, existing evidence consistently supports a relationship between the gut microbiome and both brain tumor development and treatment outcomes.

## 170. The Role of Livestock Antibiotic Use in Microbiota Dysbiosis and Neuroinflammation.

Antibiotic overuse in livestock is a major concern, as it contributes to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and may adversely affect both animal and human health. One important consequence is its impact on the gut microbiota, a complex microbial ecosystem essential for maintaining host health. A growing body of research highlights the critical role of a balanced gut microbiota in maintaining the integrity of the gut-microbiota-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (CNS). Antibiotics introduced through the food chain and the environment can disrupt microbial balance, leading to dysbiosis and systemic inflammation. In this context, the concept of "One Health" is emphasized, which recognizes the deep interconnection between the health of humans, animals, and the environment to address the global problem of antibiotic resistance. Several animal studies highlight how dysbiosis can induce neuroinflammation and potentially damage the gut-brain barrier. This review explores the mechanisms by which antibiotic use in livestock alters the gut microbiota and compromises the gut-microbiota-brain axis integrity, outlining the implications for public health and the possible link with neurodegenerative conditions.

## 171. The Microbiota-Human Health Axis.

Trillions of microorganisms play a pivotal role in maintaining health and preventing disease in humans. Their presence influences daily life, habits, energy levels, and pathologies. The present narrative review synthesized recent studies of microbial diversity across organ systems. The composition of the microbiota regulates the intestinal barrier, modulates the immune response, influences metabolism, and produces essential compounds such as short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters. Dysbiosis is associated with numerous pathologies, including metabolic, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. The microbiota is key to maintaining physiological balance and reducing disease risk. Therapeutic interventions, such as probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and microbiome transplantation, offer promising perspectives in restoring microbial homeostasis and preventing chronic diseases.

## 172. Targeting gut microbiota and its associated metabolites as a potential strategy for promoting would healing in diabetes.

Impaired healing of diabetic wounds is one of the most important complications of diabetes, often leading to lower limb amputations and incurring significant economic and psychosocial costs. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective prevention or treatment strategies available. Recent research has reported that an imbalance in the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, was linked to the onset of type 2 diabetes, as well as the development and progression of diabetic complications. Indeed, the gut microbiota has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating type 2 diabetes and related diseases. However, there is few of literatures specifically discussing the relationship between gut microbiota and diabetic wounds. This review aims to explore the potential role of the gut microbiota, especially probiotics, and its associated byproducts such as short chain fatty acids, bile acids, hydrogen sulfide, and tryptophan metabolites on wound healing to provide fresh insights and novel perspectives for the treatment of chronic wounds in diabetes.

## 173. Second brain: reviewing the gut microbiome's role in lifestyle diseases.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted another silent pandemic: lifestyle diseases. Conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, anxiety, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are increasingly becoming public health threats, affecting even younger populations worldwide. In recent years, extensive research has uncovered the pivotal role of the human gut microbiome in various aspects of human physiology, including metabolism, cellular homeostasis, immune defense, and disease development. The gut microbiome, often referred to as the "second brain," is now recognized as a key player in health and disease. Lifestyle factors such as diet, mental health, stress, exercise, and others significantly influence the composition of the gut microbiome. Imbalances in this composition, termed "dysbiosis," have been linked to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, T2D, asthma, and neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These findings underscore the profound influence of gut microbiome health on overall well-being. A working understanding of the gut microbiome's composition and its impact on disease processes is crucial for the advancement of personalized or precision medicine. This review article aims to explore recent advancements in the field, shedding light on how the gut microbiome contributes to the development and prognosis of lifestyle diseases.

## 174. An orally-administered nanotherapeutics with gold nanospheres supplying for rheumatoid arthritis therapy by re-shaping gut microbial tryptophan metabolism. Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis: Pathogenesis, Diseases, Prevention, and Therapy.

Dysbiosis of gut microbiota significantly exacerbates the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Targeting gut microbiota may present a promising therapeutic strategy for RA. Gold nanospheres (GNS), known for excellent biocompatibility, stability and minimal toxicity, have emerged as precise modulators of gut microbiota, reshaping intestinal environments to treat various inflammatory diseases. Our study found that oral administration of 60-nm GNS effectively ameliorated collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, with a marked reduction in disease severity and synovial inflammation. Specifically, GNS notably enriched the probiotic genus Ligilactobacillus while restoring intestinal barrier function by upregulating tight junction proteins Claudin-1 and ZO-1. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed GNS substantially increased the production of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in gut, which were shown to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the IPA/IAA mixture inhibited PTEN ubiquitination, stabilizing PTEN protein levels and suppressing NF-κB activation in synovial tissues. These changes correlated with reduced synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory infiltration. Our findings established GNS as an effective nanomodulator of the gut-joint axis, providing novel insights into microbiota-targeted therapies for RA and other inflammatory diseases. Dysbiosis refers to the disruption of the gut microbiota balance and is the pathological basis of various diseases. The main pathogenic mechanisms include impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function, inflammation activation, immune dysregulation, and metabolic abnormalities. These mechanisms involve dysfunctions in the gut-brain axis, gut-liver axis, and others to cause broader effects. Although the association between diseases caused by dysbiosis has been extensively studied, many questions remain regarding the specific pathogenic mechanisms and treatment strategies. This review begins by examining the causes of gut microbiota dysbiosis and summarizes the potential mechanisms of representative diseases caused by microbiota imbalance. It integrates clinical evidence to explore preventive and therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbiota dysregulation, emphasizing the importance of understanding gut microbiota dysbiosis. Finally, we summarized the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in the gut microbiota research and suggested that it will play a critical role in future studies on gut dysbiosis. The research combining multiomics technologies and AI will further uncover the complex mechanisms of gut microbiota dysbiosis. It will drive the development of personalized treatment strategies.

## 175. The potential therapeutic approaches targeting gut health in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS): a narrative review.

BACKGROUND: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disorder characterized by persistent fatigue and cognitive impairments, with emerging evidence highlighting the role of gut health in its pathophysiology. The main objective of this review was to synthesize qualitative and quantitative data from research examining the gut microbiota composition, inflammatory markers, and therapeutic outcomes of interventions targeting the microbiome in the context of ME/CFS. METHODS: The data collection involved a detailed search of peer-reviewed English literature from January 1995 to January 2025, focusing on studies related to the microbiome and ME/CFS. This comprehensive search utilized databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, with keywords including "ME/CFS," "Gut-Brain Axis," "Gut Health," "Intestinal Dysbiosis," "Microbiome Dysbiosis," "Pathophysiology," and "Therapeutic Approaches." Where possible, insights from clinical trials and observational studies were included to enrich the findings. A narrative synthesis method was also employed to effectively organize and present these findings. RESULTS: The study found notable changes in the gut microbiota diversity and composition in ME/CFS patients, contributing to systemic inflammation and worsening cognitive and physical impairments. As a result, various microbiome interventions like probiotics, prebiotics, specific diets, supplements, fecal microbiota transplantation, pharmacological interventions, improved sleep, and moderate exercise training are potential therapeutic strategies that merit further exploration. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions focusing on the gut-brain axis may help reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms in ME/CFS by utilizing the benefits of the microbiome. Therefore, identifying beneficial microbiome elements and incorporating their assessments into clinical practice can enhance patient care through personalized treatments. Due to the complexity of ME/CFS, which involves genetic, environmental, and microbial factors, a multidisciplinary approach is also necessary. Since current research lacks comprehensive insights into how gut health might aid ME/CFS treatment, standardized diagnostics and longitudinal studies could foster innovative therapies, potentially improving quality of life and symptom management for those affected.

## 176. Impact of gut microbiota in chronic kidney disease: natural polyphenols as beneficial regulators.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a severe health risk with high morbidity and mortality, profoundly affecting patient quality of life and survival. Despite advancements in research, the pathophysiology of CKD remains incompletely understood. Growing evidence links CKD with shifts in gut microbiota function and composition. Natural compounds, particularly polyphenols, have shown promise in CKD treatment due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to modulate gut microbiota. This review discusses recent progress in uncovering the connections between gut microbiota and CKD, including microbiota changes across different kidney diseases. We also examine metabolite alterations,such as trimethylamine-N-oxide, tryptophan derivatives, branched-chain amino acids, short-chain fatty acids, and bile acids,which contribute to CKD progression. Further, we outline the mechanisms through which polyphenols exert therapeutic effects on CKD, focusing on signaling pathways like nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3), phosphatidylin-ositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), and toll like receptors (TLR), as well as their impact on gut microbiota. Lastly, we consider how dietary polyphenols could be harnessed as bioactive drugs to slow CKD progression. Future research should prioritize multi-omics approaches to identify patients who would benefit from polyphenolic interventions, enabling personalized treatment strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

## 177. Modulating Gut Microbiota with Dietary Components: A Novel Strategy for Cancer-Depression Comorbidity Management.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota play a critical role in mediating the bidirectional association between cancer and depression. Emerging evidence indicates that adjusting the dietary component intake can significantly alter gut microbiota composition, thereby influencing the host's metabolism and immune function. Changes in gut microbiota and their metabolites may represent key factors in preventing cancer-depression comorbidity. METHODS: English publications were searched in databases including the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed using a series of keywords: "cancer", "depression", "gut microbiota", "dietary components", and related terms, individually or in combination. The search focused on preclinical and clinical studies describing the regulatory effects of dietary component interventions. RESULTS: This narrative review summarizes the associations among gut microbiota, cancer, and depression, and synthesizes current evidence on the modulatory effects and mechanisms of specific dietary component interventions, including dietary patterns, probiotics, prebiotics, and diet-derived phytochemicals, on gut microbiota. On the one hand, these interventions inhibit abnormal proliferation signals in the tumor microenvironment and enhance anticancer immune responses; on the other hand, they modulate neurotransmitter homeostasis, suppress neuroinflammation, and improve mood behaviors through the gut-brain axis interactions mediated by microbial metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: The complex associations among cancer, depression, and gut microbiota require further clarification. Modulating gut microbiota composition through dietary components represents a novel therapeutic strategy for improving cancer-depression comorbidity. Regulated gut microbiota enhance immune homeostasis and intestinal barrier function, while their metabolites bidirectionally modulate one another via systemic circulation and the gut-brain axis, thereby improving both the tumor microenvironment and depressive-like behaviors in cancer patients while reducing the adverse effects of cancer.

## 178. The Multifactorial Pathogenesis of Endometriosis: A Narrative Review Integrating Hormonal, Immune, and Microbiome Aspects.

Endometriosis (EM) is a common estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory disorder affecting reproductive-aged women, yet its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota significantly influence immune responses, estrogen metabolism, and systemic inflammation, potentially contributing to EM progression. This narrative review explores the relationship between the gut microbiota and EM, emphasizing microbial dysbiosis, inflammation, estrogen regulation, and potential microbiome-targeted therapies. Studies published within the last 30 years were included, focusing on the microbiota composition, immune modulation, estrogen metabolism, and therapeutic interventions in EM. The selection criteria prioritized peer-reviewed articles, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and narrative reviews investigating the gut microbiota's role in EM pathophysiology and treatment. Microbial dysbiosis in EM is characterized by a reduced abundance of beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Ruminococcaceae) and an increased prevalence of pro-inflammatory taxa (Escherichia/Shigella, Streptococcus, and Bacteroides). The gut microbiota modulate estrogen metabolism via the estrobolome, contributing to increased systemic estrogen levels and lesion proliferation. Additionally, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria activate the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, exacerbating inflammation and EM symptoms. The interaction between the gut microbiota, immune dysregulation, and estrogen metabolism suggests a critical role in EM pathogenesis. While microbiota-targeted interventions offer potential therapeutic benefits, further large-scale, multi-center studies are needed to validate microbial biomarkers and optimize microbiome-based therapies for EM. Integrating microbiome research with precision medicine may enhance the diagnostic accuracy and improve the EM treatment efficacy.

## 179. Gut Mycobiome: Latest Findings and Current Knowledge Regarding Its Significance in Human Health and Disease.

The gut mycobiome, the fungal component of the gut microbiota, plays a crucial role in health and disease. Although fungi represent a small fraction of the gut ecosystem, they influence immune responses, gut homeostasis, and disease progression. The mycobiome's composition varies with age, diet, and host factors, and its imbalance has been linked to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic disorders. Advances in sequencing have expanded our understanding of gut fungi, but challenges remain due to methodological limitations and high variability between individuals. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including antifungals, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions, show promise but require further study. This review highlights recent discoveries on the gut mycobiome, its interactions with bacteria, its role in disease, and potential clinical applications. A deeper understanding of fungal contributions to gut health will help develop targeted microbiome-based therapies.

## 180. The Role of Microbiota in the Pathogenesis of Bullous Pemphigoid and Pemphigus Vulgaris: Evidence, Controversies, and Perspectives.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) represent the most prevalent conditions among autoimmune bullous skin diseases, considered a major cause of severe morbidity and, in certain cases, mortality. The hallmark of the two diseases is the presence of autoantibodies directed against proteins located in the basement membrane of the skin, which determines the formation of blisters. In recent years, interest in the role of microbiota in relation to health-disease status has progressively increased. In particular, based on the gut–skin axis, accumulating evidence has emerged on the potential association between the composition and diversity of microbial communities in the gut, skin, and even in the oral cavity and the risk of developing BP and PV. Dysbiosis, characterized by a generally higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and a depletion of probiotics/beneficial species, might contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases. Despite the still limited number of studies and the need for further large-scale multicenter studies, the knowledge gathered so far is suggestive of a novel modifiable risk factor representing a potential target for adjuvant treatments of these disabling and life-threatening conditions.

## 181. Gut microbiota and its influence on the Gut-Brain axis in comparison with chemotherapy patients and cancer-free control data in Breast cancer-A computational perspective.

Breast cancer (BC) continues to be a major cause of cancer-related illness and death among women worldwide. Traditional treatments include surgery, radiation, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy, but these approaches often face challenges due to variability in patient response and adverse effects. This study investigated the relationship between gut microbiome diversity, community composition, and pathway analysis in women undergoing chemotherapy for BC (During Treatment-DT) compared to cancer-free controls (CFC). Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, the study assessed alpha and beta diversity. Results showed differences in microbiome composition between DT and CFC samples, with Firmicutes being highly abundant in both groups. Core microbiome and correlation analysis at the phylum and genus levels identified significant microbiota. Specifically, the abundance of genera such as Pseudomonas and Akkermansia decreased, while Ruminococcus and Allistipes increased, as determined by statistical and machine learning approaches. Disease associations were examined based on KO abundance, identifying links to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, Clostridium difficile infection, chronic kidney disease, and multiple sclerosis. Key KEGG pathways enriched in DT and CFC groups included the two-component system, tyrosine metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Conversely, dysbiosis or the presence of pathogenic bacteria (Ruminococcus) associated with the SOX8 gene could lead to chemoresistance, altered metabolic pathways, and increased toxicity. These findings underscore the potential implications for treatment outcomes and personalized medicine.

## 182. The role of plant-based dietary compounds in gut microbiota modulation in inflammatory bowel disease.

IBD, which includes Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis. The dysbiotic environment results in an elevation of harmful microbiota and a diminution of advantageous microbiota, leading to IBD. Interestingly, plant-based dietary compounds consisting of dietary fibers and polyphenols have demonstrated promise to be safe and successful in IBD treatment, with studies revealing that they can improve dysbiosis, increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, lower oxidative stress, and improve barrier function. Plant-based dietary compounds have shown potential to reduce IBD by regulating signaling pathways such as TGF-β/Smad, TRL-4/NF-κB/MAPK, TLR2-NF-κB, autophagy, pyroptosis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism, Nrf-2/HO-1, microbiota-macrophage-arginine metabolism, and bile acid metabolism. Additionally, they assist in forming short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites, which help regulate immune cells to alleviate IBD. Recent research indicates that dietary compounds, either as nanoparticles or encapsulated in nanoparticles, have shown potential in effectively treating IBD. Despite the beneficial role of plant-based dietary compounds, other studies have shown detrimental effects such as cancer promotion and exacerbation of immune responses. Therefore, this will help clinicians/individuals to plan their nutrition to prevent IBD exacerbation. This review highlights the microbiota signatures linked to IBD and examines the impact of gut dysbiosis on IBD. It also provides a comprehensive discussion of how plant-based dietary compounds can influence the modulation of dysbiotic gut microbiota in IBD. Plant-based dietary compounds hold potential for treating IBD.

## 183. Gut Expansion of a Human Lupus Pathobiont is Associated With Autoantibody Production and T Cell Dysregulation.

OBJECTIVE: The mechanisms by which the gut microbiome contributes to lupus pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The anaerobe Ruminococcus gnavus (RG) expands in patients with lupus in association with flares. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which candidate pathobiont lipoglycan-producing RG2 may contribute to autoimmunity and to identify factors promoting its expansion. METHODS: The consequences of RG colonization or depletion were evaluated in the B6.Sle1.Sle2.Sle3 triple congenic (TC) lupus model by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RG lysates were tested on Treg cells in vitro. Fecal microbiota transfers evaluated the contribution of the microbiome origin from lupus or control donors and dietary tryptophan. RG1 and RG2 growth and metabolome were evaluated in response to tryptophan in vitro. RESULTS: Only RG2 stably colonized TC mice, in which it induced autoantibody production and T cell activation. Depletion of anaerobes had the opposite effect, with an increased Treg frequency. RG2 induced Treg apoptosis in cocultures with dendritic cells. RG is present in TC microbiota, from which it is amplified by tryptophan. The combination of TC microbiota and high dietary tryptophan induced autoimmune activation and intestinal inflammation in healthy control mice. Finally, tryptophan enhanced RG2 growth and production of immunomodulatory metabolites. CONCLUSION: RG2 contributes to autoimmune activation, at least by inducing Treg apoptosis. The expansion of this pathobiont is promoted by host genetic factors and tryptophan metabolism. Thus, targeted RG2 depletion may improve disease outcomes in patients with lupus.

## 184. Reframing type 1 diabetes through the endocannabinoidome-microbiota axis: a systems biology perspective.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has long been recognized as a T-cell-driven autoimmune disease. However, growing evidence highlights the involvement of metabolic, inflammatory, and gut microbiota-related factors in its progression. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), a key regulator of immune and metabolic homeostasis, has been increasingly implicated in autoimmune pathophysiology, particularly through its interactions with gut-derived metabolites. This hypothesis article underscores the need to reframe T1D pathophysiology by integrating ECS dysfunction, gut dysbiosis, and metabolic imbalances into a systems biology framework. The proposed Endocannabinoidome-Microbiota (ECBoM) model highlights a shared hallmark of autoimmunity-SCFA depletion, increased intestinal permeability, and ECS dysregulation-as key drivers of chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction. These disturbances, observed in T1D as well as in celiac disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, suggest a common immune-metabolic axis across autoimmune disorders. Recognizing ECS dysregulation as a systemic feature of autoimmunity opens avenues for novel therapeutic interventions, including ECS-targeted treatments, microbiota modulation, and phytocannabinoid-based therapies. This article highlights the necessity of conducting large-scale, multi-omics studies to establish disease-specific ECS signatures, linking endocannabinoid profiling, microbiota composition, and metabolic biomarkers to disease progression. By advocating for a paradigm shift in T1D research, this article emphasizes the importance of exploring new mechanistic references to develop targeted, immune-metabolic interventions that could reshape treatment strategies and improve clinical outcomes in T1D and related autoimmune diseases.

## 185. Unraveling the link between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and osteoporosis: a bridging function of gut microbiota.

This review examines the strong association between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and osteoporosis (OP), with a particular focus on the role of gut microbiota in linking these two disorders. Both MASLD and OP are closely linked to metabolic syndrome, and their pathogenesis involves multiple factors, such as inflammatory response, insulin resistance, altered intestinal permeability, and estrogen deficiency. Dysregulation of gut microbiota not only affects hepatic fat accumulation and bone metabolism disorders through metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, but also exacerbates systemic chronic inflammation by impairing the intestinal barrier function, thus accelerating the progression of both diseases. This article summarizes recent studies that highlight the central role of gut microbiota as a co-morbid factor in MASLD and OP, offering new perspectives for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## 186. NFKB1-targeted metabolites as novel therapeutic approaches for erectile dysfunction: evidence from gut microbiota network pharmacology and machine learning.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota may contribute to the pathogenesis of erectile dysfunction (ED). AIM: To investigate the potential causal relationship between specific gut microbial taxa and ED, identify key microbial metabolites and their associated target genes, and evaluate their therapeutic potential through computational drug screening. METHODS: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for gut microbiota and ED were obtained from the MiBioGen, IEU OpenGWAS, and FinnGen databases. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using the TwoSampleMR package to assess potential causal relationships. A microbiota-metabolite-target gene network was constructed using data from GutMGene, Super-PRED, and GeneCards databases to explore the microbiota-host interaction axis. The DeepPurpose machine learning framework was utilized to predict drug-target binding affinities, and top-ranking drug-gene pairs were validated by molecular docking to assess binding free energies and confirm interaction stability. OUTCOMES: The study aimed to identify specific gut microbiota, metabolites, and target genes associated with ED and evaluate their therapeutic potential. RESULTS: MR analysis revealed a negative association between ED and the gut microbial genera Alistipes, Butyricicoccus, and Dialister, suggesting a potential protective role. Machine learning predictions indicated strong binding affinities between target genes (NFKB1, TLR4, CYP3A4) and bile acid derivatives (Tauroursodeoxycholic acid and Taurochenodeoxycholic acid). Molecular docking confirmed high binding affinities of NFKB1 to Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (-9.81 kcal/mol) and Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (-9.35 kcal/mol). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that gut microbiota and their metabolites could serve as potential therapeutic targets for ED interventions. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The study provides novel insights into the gut microbiota-ED relationship by integrating multi-omics data and advanced computational methods. However, validation in preclinical or clinical studies is needed to translate these findings into therapeutic applications. CONCLUSION: Specific gut microbiota, through metabolites and associated target genes, may influence the onset of ED. These findings highlight potential therapeutic targets and provide a basis for future interventions in ED treatment.

## 187. Gut microbes-spinal connection is required for itch sensation. Simulated Microplastic Release from Cutting Boards and Evaluation of Intestinal Inflammation and Gut Microbiota in Mice.

The gut microbiota has been linked to a number of neurological disorders. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota is involved in the genesis of chronic itch, a refractory condition that afflicts patients both physically and mentally. Here, we report that depletion of gut microbiota enhances tolerance to itch in mice orally administered with antibiotics (ABX) and mice free of germ. Of note, oral gavage with Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis), a prominent species of the genus Bacteroides with most differential change, corrected the ABX-induced itch dysfunction through its driven metabolite acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC). Mechanistically, gut microbiota or B. fragilis depletion caused a decrease in RNA N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) demethylase FTO expression in the dorsal horn and a consequent increase in RNA m(6)A sites in Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor F (MrgprF) mRNA, leading to decreased MRGPRF protein. The downregulation of FTO was triggered by inactivation of ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1), a transcription factor that binds to the Fto promoter. These findings support a gut microbe - spinal connection in modulation of itch sensation in RNA m(6)A epigenetic-dependent manner and highlight a critical role of ALC in linking the altered B. fragilis and itch dysfunction. BACKGROUND: Plastic cutting boards are commonly used in food preparation, increasing human exposure to microplastics (MPs). However, the health implications are still not well understood. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of long-term exposure to MPs released from cutting boards on intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota. METHODS: MPs were incorporated into mouse diets by cutting the food on polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and willow wooden (WB) cutting boards, and the diets were fed to mice over periods of 4 and 12 wk. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10), lipopolysaccharide (LPS, an endotoxin), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), along with ileum and colon levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), TNF-α, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), were measured using mouse enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The mRNA expression of mucin 2 and intestinal tight junction proteins in mouse ileum and colon tissues was quantified using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Fecal microbiota, fecal metabolomics, and liver metabolomics were characterized. RESULTS: PP and PE cutting boards released MPs, with concentrations reaching 1,088 ± 95.0 and 1,211 ± 322 μg/g in diets, respectively, and displaying mean particle sizes of 10.4 ± 0.96 vs. 27.4 ± 1.45 μm. Mice fed diets prepared on PP cutting boards for 12 wk exhibited significantly higher serum levels of LPS, CRP, TNF-α, IL-10, and CEA, as well as higher levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, MDA, SOD, and MLCK in the ileum and colon compared with mice fed diets prepared on WB cutting boards. These mice also showed lower relative expression of Occludin and Zonula occludens-1 in the ileum and colon. In contrast, mice exposed to diets prepared on PE cutting boards for 12 wk did not show evident inflammation; however, there was a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and an increase in Desulfobacterota compared with those fed diets prepared on WB cutting boards, and exposure to diets prepared on PE cutting boards over 12 wk also altered mouse fecal and liver metabolites compared with those fed diets prepared on WB cutting boards. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that MPs from PP cutting boards impair intestinal barrier function and induce inflammation, whereas those from PE cutting boards affect the gut microbiota, gut metabolism, and liver metabolism in the mouse model. These findings offer crucial insights into the safe use of plastic cutting boards. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15472.

## 188. The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Heart Failure: Pathophysiological Insights and Future Perspectives.

The gut microbiota has emerged as a crucial player in cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure (HF). Recent studies have highlighted the bidirectional interaction between the gut and the heart, often referred to as the gut-heart axis. Dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in microbial composition and function, has been linked to systemic inflammation, metabolic disturbances, and impaired cardiovascular homeostasis. This review explores the mechanisms through which gut microbiota influences HF, including microbial metabolite production, inflammatory pathways, endothelial dysfunction, hormonal modulation, fluid retention, and sodium absorption. The potential therapeutic implications of microbiota modulation through diet, probiotics, and pharmacological interventions are also discussed. Understanding these mechanisms could pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the management of HF. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to establish causality and the development of personalized microbiota-based interventions.

## 189. Pathological Alterations in Human Blood Microbiome-An Updated Review.

The main source of microorganisms in the blood is the intestinal and oral microflora through the route of atopobiosis. It is clear that the blood microbiome undergoes significant changes in response to various pathological conditions within the human body. In this review, we summarized data from studies of the human blood microbiome in diseases of the nervous system and cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, kidney, and metabolite disorders. Links between the blood microbiome and the above mentioned diseases are demonstrated. In support of this understanding, it is evident that analogous alterations in microbiome composition occur across various disease categories; however, the microbial signatures associated with the blood microbiome exhibit specificity. For instance, an elevated abundancy of Proteobacteria has been identified in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disorders. Conversely, while Firmicutes are found to be abundant in renal and metabolic conditions, their levels are diminished in cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, patients suffering from respiratory and liver ailments typically show a heightened presence of Bacteroidetes; notably, Flavobacterium is prevalent in respiratory diseases, whereas Enterobacteriaceae is associated with liver diseases. Hence, the human blood microbiome could be considered as a potential biomarker in certain diseases.

## 190. Gut microbiota in regulatory T cell generation and function: mechanisms and health implications.

The establishment and maintenance of immune homeostasis rely on a dynamic, bidirectional exchange of information between commensal microorganisms and the host immune system. At the center of this process are CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), which have emerged as pivotal mediators to ensure immunological equilibrium. This review explores the sophisticated mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates the differentiation, expansion, and functional specialization of Tregs, orchestrating intestinal immune tolerance to support host-microbiota mutualism. We discuss the role of microbial-derived structural components and metabolites in shaping the immunoregulatory fitness of Tregs. Additionally, we explore the impact of gut microbial dysbiosis, where disrupted microbial-immune crosstalk compromises immune tolerance, contributing to the development of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Finally, we highlight the potential of microbiota-based strategies to recalibrate intestinal immunity and restore immune tolerance.

## 191. The microbiota in breast cancer: dysbiosis, microbial metabolites, and therapeutic implications.

The human microbiome plays a pivotal role in host health and disease, with emerging evidence underscoring its significant influence on the development and progression of breast cancer. Studies have revealed that dysbiosis in both the gut and breast tissue microbiota is strongly associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. Distinct microbial profiles have been identified among healthy individuals, patients with benign breast conditions, and those with malignant tumors, with further variations observed across different ethnic groups and breast cancer subtypes. The complex interplay between breast cancer risk factors and microbial populations, coupled with the direct impact of microbial communities and their metabolites on inflammatory pathways and immune responses, underscores the importance of this field. Additionally, the interaction between gut microbiota and therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy is of particular interest, as these interactions can significantly influence treatment outcomes, either enhancing or diminishing efficacy. This review explores the effects of the Mediterranean diet, probiotics, prebiotics, and natural medicinal products on gut microbiota, emphasizing their potential as innovative therapeutic strategies. Notably, the use of engineered probiotics within the tumor microenvironment represents a promising frontier in breast cancer treatment. In conclusion, research on the human microbiome not only deepens our understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis but also lays the groundwork for the development of novel and targeted therapeutic interventions.

## 192. Correlation of the intestinal flora and its metabolites with the colonic transport function in functional constipation.

BACKGROUND: Functional constipation (FC) is a clinically frequent intestinal disorder. A growing body of evidence emphasizes the link between intestinal microecological imbalance and constipation. However, the microbiota composition associated with FC and the mechanisms by which metabolites influence gut motility remain poorly understood. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 60 participants (20 FC patients with delayed colonic transit time, 20 FC patients with normal colonic transit time, and 20 healthy controls), and macrogenomics and metabolomics were used to assess the differences in the microbiota and metabolite composition of different colonic transit functions in FC. In addition to assessing clinical symptoms, this study aimed to better understand how intestinal flora contributed to impaired gut motility in FC patients. RESULTS: Significant microbiota taxonomic differences were observed across different gut dynamics in FC; Alistipes, Akkermansia, Oscillibacter, Ruthenibacterium, Alistipes_onderdonkii, and Ruthenibacterium_lactatiformans were key bacteria in FC patients with delayed colonic transit time; Roseburia and Klebsiella_pneumoniae were key bacteria in FC patients with normal colonic transit time; and Escherichia, Enterobacter, Escherichia_coli, Ruminococcus gnavus, Enterobacter_cloacae_complex, and Megamonas_funiformis were the key organisms in healthy controls. The metabolomics analysis revealed three differentially abundant short-chain fatty acids: acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. Furthermore, there were 11 differentially abundant bile acids, including β-muricholic acid and nor-deoxycholic acid. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between the 14 differential bacteria and the 14 metabolites, Notably, Roseburia was positively correlated with butyrate and acetate levels (FDR < 0.05). In addition, Oscillibacter showed positive correlations with several BAs, including nor-deoxycholic acid, isoallolithocholic acid, α-muricholic acid, β-muricholic acid, 5α-cholanic acid-3α-ol, and dehydrolithocholic acid (FDR < 0.05). The Spearman's |r |value >0.6 combination in the correlation analysis between fecal differential bacteria and differentially abundant metabolites revealed an AUC value of 0.854 between FC patients and healthy controls, indicating good predictive ability. CONCLUSION: The identified differences in the composition and metabolites of different colonic transmission-dynamic microbiota in FC further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in FC pathogenesis and may provide new insights into diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.

## 193. The effects of a semen cuscutae flavonoids-based antidepressant treatment on microbiome and metabolome in mice.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Previous studies have shown that Semen Cuscutae flavonoids (SCFs) exert antidepressant effects by modulating the microbiota-neuroinflammation axis and ameliorating hippocampal metabolic disturbances. However, the impact of SCFs on gut microbiota and related metabolomics remains largely undefined. Given that the gut microbiota has been proven to play a significant role in the etiology of depression and serves as a promising target for its treatment in humans, this study aims to elucidate the antidepressant effects of SCFs and to investigate how they modulate microbial and metabolic pathways to alleviate depressive symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mice were used as a depression model. The normal mice and CUMS-induced mice were treated with either vehicle or with SCFs. A range of standardized behavioral assays and physiological indicators were employed to evaluate the antidepressant effects of SCFs. Upon the confirmation of the effectiveness of the SCFs treatment, the composition, richness, and diversity of the fecal microbiota were assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, fecal metabolic profiling was analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS-based metabolomics. Multivariate data analysis was subsequently performed to identify differential metabolites and characterize alterations in fecal metabolites. Furthermore, a correlation analysis between differential metabolites and key microbiota was conducted. RESULTS: SCFs significantly ameliorated depressive behaviors and the dysregulated diversity of fecal microbiota induced by CUMS. SCFs enhanced the gut microbiota structure in the CUMS group by increasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio, significantly elevating the abundance of Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, and Actinobacteria while reducing the abundance of Bacteroidota and Bacteroides in CUMS-treated mice. Fecal metabolomics analyses revealed that SCFs could modulate metabolic pathways, including aldosterone synthesis and secretion, arachidonic acid metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Mice with depression induced by CUMS exhibited disturbances in both their gut microbiota and fecal metabolism. However, SCFs restored the balance of the microbial community and corrected metabolic disturbances in feces, exerting antidepressant effects through a multifaceted mechanism.

## 194. The Relationship Between Gut Microbiota and Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion.

Recently, the gut microbiota has been found to be associated with multiple organs and systems in the human body, playing a key role in the occurrence and development of various diseases, such as the gut-brain axis and the gut-liver axis. However, its interaction with miscarriages remains poorly understood. This article reviews the characteristics of gut microbiota and its metabolites in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), the mechanism of gut microbiota inducing RSA, and potential therapeutic strategies. Therefore, it provides a new perspective on the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and treatment of recurrent abortion, and the prospect of the future research direction of gut microbiota and recurrent abortion is proposed based on existing studies.

## 195. Gut Microbiota-Targeted Intervention of Hyperlipidemia Using Monascus-Fermented Ginseng.

Background/Objectives: Hyperlipidemia (HLP) encompasses a spectrum of poorly understood lipid metabolism disorders that are frequently overlooked or misdiagnosed, potentially leading to multiple complications. While the gut microbiota has been implicated in HLP pathogenesis, the causal relationships and molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of Monascus-fermented ginseng (MFG) on HLP through gut microbiota modulation and explore treatment potential via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Methods: The MFG-modulated gut microbiota was transplanted into HLP mice. Systemic evaluations, including serum biochemical parameter detection, histopathological section analysis, 16S rRNA sequencing, and fecal metabolomics, were conducted to assess therapeutic efficacy and identify associated metabolic pathways. Results: FMT significantly improved lipid profiles, reduced body weight, and attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation in HLP mice. Mechanistically, it enhanced cholesterol excretion and fatty acid β-oxidation while suppressing lipogenic regulators, concurrently promoting primary-to-secondary bile acid conversion. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that the MFG intervention effectively normalized the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and enriched beneficial microbiota. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate FMT's therapeutic value in HLP management and provide new perspectives on utilizing fermented herbal medicines for metabolic disorders via gut microbiota reprogramming.

## 196. The impact of metabolic reprogramming on tertiary lymphoid structure formation: enhancing cancer immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Cancer immunotherapy has achieved unprecedented success in the field of cancer therapy. However, its potential is constrained by a low therapeutic response rate. MAIN BODY: Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) plays a crucial role in antitumor immunity and is associated with a good prognosis. Metabolic reprogramming, as a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment, can influence tumor immunity and promote the formation of follicular helper T cells and germinal centers. However, many current studies focus on the correlation between metabolism and TLS formation factors, and there is insufficient direct evidence to suggest that metabolism drives TLS formation. This review provided a comprehensive summary of the relationship between metabolism and TLS formation, highlighting glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and vitamin metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, an in-depth exploration of how metabolism affects cell interactions and the role of microorganisms in TLS will significantly advance our understanding of metabolism-enhanced antitumor immunity.

## 197. Characterization of Sex-Based Differences in Gut Microbiota That Correlate with Suppression of Lupus in Female BWF1 Mice.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is more prevalent in female mice and humans and is associated with microbiota dysbiosis. We analyzed the fecal microbiota composition in female and male NZBxNZWF1 (BWF1) mice, a model of SLE, using 16S RNA gene sequencing. Composition of gut microbiota differed between adult disease-prone female (pre-disease) and disease-resistant male mice. Transfer of male cecal contents by gavage into female mice suppressed kidney disease (decreased proteinuria) and improved survival. After our mouse colony was moved to a new barrier facility with similar housing, male cecal transplants failed to suppress disease in female recipients. After two years, the protective phenotype reemerged: male cecal transplants once again suppressed disease in female mice. We compared the gut microbiota composition in female and male BWF1 mice for the three different periods, during which the male microbiota either protected or failed to protect female recipients. In female vs. male mice and in female mice receiving male cecal transplants, we found Bacteroides was high, Clostridium was low (high Bacteroides/Clostridium ratio), and Alistipes was present during periods when male cecal transplants suppressed disease. These data suggest that specific bacterial populations may have opposing effects on disease suppression in a model of microbiota transplantation.

## 198. Interaction Between Microbiota and Immunity: Molecular Mechanisms, Biological Functions, Diseases, and New Therapeutic Opportunities.

The microbiota is pivotal for our health. It includes different phyla like Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. The interaction between microbiota and immunity shares a bidirectional relationship. The microbiota helps to stimulate immunity development. The immunity influences microbial composition in turn. This interaction is critical for maintaining homeostasis, preventing pathogen invasion, and regulating the immune system. Furthermore, this symbiotic relationship is crucial for maintaining overall health and preventing various diseases. The microbiota-immune system contributes to immune system maturation, while the immune system selects for beneficial microbiota composition, thus enhancing our immunity. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of the interaction between microbiota and immunity, offering solid evidence for the role of microbiota in immune regulation. Notably, the review categorizes microbiota according to phyla and explains disease associations, molecular effectors, and functional outcomes about the microbiota-immune system. We also introduced three core molecular mechanisms of the microbiota-immune systems. Moreover, we detail the progression from target discovery to clinical trial design for bacterial and immune-related diseases. Finally, we propose four therapeutic strategies for diseases.

## 199. Intestinal biofilms: pathophysiological relevance, host defense, and therapeutic opportunities.

SUMMARYThe human intestinal tract harbors a profound variety of microorganisms that live in symbiosis with the host and each other. It is a complex and highly dynamic environment whose homeostasis directly relates to human health. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and polymicrobial biofilms have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases, and colorectal cancers. This review covers the molecular composition and organization of intestinal biofilms, mechanistic aspects of biofilm signaling networks for bacterial communication and behavior, and synergistic effects in polymicrobial biofilms. It further describes the clinical relevance and diseases associated with gut biofilms, the role of biofilms in antimicrobial resistance, and the intestinal host defense system and therapeutic strategies counteracting biofilms. Taken together, this review summarizes the latest knowledge and research on intestinal biofilms and their role in gut disorders and provides directions toward the development of biofilm-specific treatments.

## 200. The Role of Oxidative Stress in Ischaemic Stroke and the Influence of Gut Microbiota.

Ischaemic stroke is the most prevalent stroke subtype, accounting for 80-90% of all cases worldwide, and remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Its pathophysiology involves complex molecular cascades, with oxidative stress playing a central role. During cerebral ischaemia, reduced blood flow deprives neurons of essential oxygen and nutrients, triggering excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Not only do these species damage cellular components, but they also activate inflammatory pathways, particularly those mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). The pro-inflammatory milieu intensifies neuronal damage, compromises blood-brain barrier integrity, and exacerbates reperfusion-induced damage. Recent findings highlight the importance of the gut microbiota in modulating stroke outcomes, primarily through metabolic and immunological interactions along the gut-brain axis. Dysbiosis, characterised by reduced microbial diversity and an imbalance between beneficial and harmful strains, has been linked to increased systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and worse prognoses. Specific gut-derived metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), appear to either mitigate or intensify neuronal injury. SCFAs may strengthen the blood-brain barrier and temper inflammatory responses, whereas elevated TMAO levels may increase thrombotic risk. This narrative review consolidates both experimental and clinical data demonstrating the central role of oxidative stress in ischaemic stroke pathophysiology and explores the gut microbiota's ability to modulate these damaging processes. Therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative pathways or rebalancing gut microbial composition, such as antioxidant supplementation, dietary modulation, probiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation, present promising paradigms for stroke intervention. However, their widespread clinical implementation is hindered by a lack of large-scale, randomised trials. Future efforts should employ a multidisciplinary approach to elucidate the intricate mechanisms linking oxidative stress and gut dysbiosis to ischaemic stroke, thereby paving the way for novel, mechanism-based therapies for improved patient outcomes.

## 201. Akkermansia muciniphila reverses neuronal atrophy in Negr1 knockout mice with depression-like phenotypes.

Genetic predispositions can shape the gut microbiome, which in turn modulates host gene expression and impacts host physiology. The complex interplay between host genetics and the gut microbiome likely contributes to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, yet the mechanisms behind these interactions remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the gut microbiota in Negr1 knockout (KO) mice, which exhibit anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, as NEGR1 (neuronal growth regulator 1) is a cell adhesion molecule linked to neuronal development and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings show significant early-life alterations in the gut microbiota composition of Negr1 KO mice, most notably a marked reduction in Akkermansia spp. along with reduced dendritic arborization and spine density in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Remarkably, daily administration of an Akkermansia strain isolated from wild-type mice reversed the neuronal structural abnormalities and ameliorated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in Negr1 KO mice. Transcriptomic profiling revealed upregulation of mitochondrial genome-encoded genes in the NAc and hippocampus of Negr1 KO mice, along with a predisposition toward a pro-inflammatory state in the colon of Negr1 KO mice. The Akkermansia supplementation downregulated these mitochondrial genes in the NAc and hippocampus and upregulated genes involved in T cell activation and immune homeostasis in the colon. These findings demonstrate a novel gene-microbiome interaction in the pathophysiology of Negr1 KO mice, positioning Akkermansia spp. as a key mediator that improves neuronal atrophy and modulates anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Our study provides compelling evidence for bidirectional interactions between host genetics and the gut microbiome in modulating neuropsychiatric phenotypes, offering new insights for addressing genetically influenced mental disorders.

## 202. The Gut Mycobiome for Precision Medicine.

The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a vast array of microorganisms, which play essential roles in maintaining metabolic balance and immune function. While bacteria dominate the gut microbiome, fungi represent a much smaller, often overlooked fraction. Despite their relatively low abundance, fungi may significantly influence both health and disease. Advances in next-generation sequencing, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics, and computational biology have provided novel opportunities to study the gut mycobiome, shedding light on its composition, functional genes, and metabolite interactions. Emerging evidence links fungal dysbiosis to various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurological conditions. The gut mycobiome also presents a promising avenue for precision medicine, particularly in biomarker discovery, disease diagnostics, and targeted therapeutics. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain in effectively integrating gut mycobiome knowledge into clinical practice. This review examines gut fungal microbiota, highlighting analytical methods, associations with human diseases, and its potential role in precision medicine. It also discusses pathways for clinical translation, particularly in diagnosis and treatment, while addressing key barriers to implementation.

## 203. Gut sensory neurons as regulators of neuro-immune-microbial interactions: from molecular mechanisms to precision therapy for IBD/IBS.

As potentially important biosensors within the intestinal mucosal barrier, gut sensory neurons appear to dynamically orchestrate tissue homeostasis through multimodal integration of mechanical forces, chemical cues, and microbial metabolites. While current research indicates gut sensory neurons may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of IBD/IBS, the precise etiological mechanisms underlying these disorders require further investigation. In the enteric nervous system, intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) show distinct molecular characteristics compared to peripheral sensory neurons originating from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and vagal ganglia (NG/JG, nodose/jugular ganglia). These neuronal subtypes appear to orchestrate bidirectional epithelial-immune communication through context-dependent release of neurochemical signals, potentially establishing a dynamic neuromodulatory network. This comprehensive review will examine the latest findings on the relationship between these sensory neurons and intestinal diseases, and explore an integrated therapeutic framework based on a triple synergistic strategy. This framework could encompass precise molecular-level modulation through targeting neurotransmitters and their receptors, systemic-level neural regulation utilizing electrical nerve stimulation techniques, and ecological reprogramming mediated by gut microbiota. This potential approach may provide a possible translational pathway from mechanistic exploration to practical application, with implications for personalized clinical interventions for IBD/IBS.

## 204. Gut Microbiome in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-An Emerging Frontier.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an irreversible disease characterized by vascular and systemic inflammation, ultimately leading to right ventricular failure. There is a great need for adjunctive therapies to extend survival for PAH patients. The gut microbiome influences the host immune system and is a potential novel target for PAH treatment. We review the emerging preclinical and clinical evidence which strongly suggests that there is gut dysbiosis in PAH and that alterations in the gut microbiome may either initiate or facilitate the progression of PAH by modifying systemic immune responses. We also outline approaches to modify the intestinal microbiome and delineate some practical challenges that may impact efforts to translate preclinical microbiome findings to PAH patients. Finally, we briefly describe studies that demonstrate contributions of infections to PAH pathogenesis. We hope that this review will propel further investigations into the mechanisms by which gut dysbiosis impacts PAH and/or right ventricular function, approaches to modify the gut microbiome, and the impact of infections on PAH development or progression.

## 205. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches to interrogate host-microbiome interactions in mammalian systems. Detection of Volatile Organic Compounds as an emerging strategy for Parkinson's disease diagnosis and monitoring.

Covering: 2015 to 2025Chemical crosstalk is universal to all life, niche-specific, and essential to thrive. This crosstalk is mediated by a large diversity of molecules, including metal ions, small molecules, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. Among these, specialized small molecules referred to as natural products (NPs) play an important role in microbe-drug/environment interactions, microbe-microbe, and microbe-host interactions. Microbial communication using NPs allows microbes to sense quorum, form biofilms, eliminate competition, establish symbiosis, evade immune attack, and respond to stress. In most cases, the elucidation of small molecule mediators and effectors of microbe-host interactions presents a major challenge due to the relatively low abundance of microbial metabolites in a milieu of host, microbe, and environmental metabolites. Advances in analytical instrumentation, such as mass spectrometers, and both experimental as well as computational methods to analyze data, coupled with the use of model organisms, have enabled fundamental discoveries of mechanisms of small molecule-mediated host-microbe interactions. The focus of this review is to detail the approaches applied in the last decade to disentangle microbiome-derived NPs in human and murine model systems. Select recent findings from diverse biological ecosystems are discussed to inform relevant parallels and potential strategies for research in human health. Growing evidence suggests that specific volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles may reflect key pathophysiological processes in Parkinson's disease (PD), including alterations in the microbiome, metabolism, and oxidative stress. Identifying reliable VOC biomarkers could enable non-invasive tests for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapy evaluation. This review examines VOC analysis in biological matrices such as breath, skin, and stool, outlining current research and future applications in PD. We evaluate analytical techniques based on sensitivity, specificity, and clinical applicability. Additionally, we classify VOCs identified in previous studies alongside their proposed biological origins. Special attention is given to short-chain fatty acids, produced by the gut microbiome, a novel target in PD research. Our findings highlight the need for larger cohort studies and standardized protocols to advance VOC-based diagnostics in PD. Understanding the interplay between VOCs and PD may facilitate biomarker discovery, enhancing non-invasive diagnostic strategies and personalized disease management.

## 206. Alterations of fecal microbiota and plasma metabolome in patients with Parkinson's disease with rapid eye movement sleep disorder.

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (PD-RBD), a specific subtype of PD, are characterized by the presence of more severe motor and non-motor symptoms. This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics and interactions of gut microbiota and plasma metabolic characteristics of PD-RBD, thus screening for the disease mechanisms. A total of 100 PD patients, 50 healthy controls (HCs) and 16 probable idiopathic RBD (iRBD) patients were collected. There were 33 PD-RBD and 67 patients without probable RBD (PD-nRBD) in PD patients. DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and high-throughput sequencing were used for intestinal microbiota analysis, and ultra-high liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for metabolome analysis. Spearman analysis was applied to investigate the correlation of fecal microbiota and plasma metabolome. Our findings revealed Lactobacillaceae (P = 0.017), Christensenellaceae (P = 0.017), Fusobacteriaceae (P = 0.018), Lactobacillus (P = 0.035), Christensenellaceae R-7 group (P = 0.035), and Fusobacterium (P = 0.035) were significantly different in PD-RBD, PD-nRBD, and HC. Moreover, the differential metabolites identified in both PD-nRBD and PD-RBD were 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate (VIP = 5.802) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate (VIP = 5.732). Furthermore, our analysis revealed that 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate showed a positive correlation with Lactobacillus (r = 0.197, P = 0.049). Finally, functional analysis indicated that these distinctive microbiota and metabolites were primarily associated with phenylalanine metabolism and vitamin B6 metabolism. We managed to show that the differential microbiota, differential metabolites, and their interactions in PD-RBD compared to PD-nRBD and HC. This furthers our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and offers fresh perspectives on its detection and treatment. IMPORTANCE: There are currently fewer investigations on the intestinal microbiota and metabolites of probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (PD-RBD) and idiopathic RBD (iRBD). Our findings indicate that PD-RBD exhibits an increase in Christensenellaceae and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol sulfate, and that iRBD exhibits a similar trend. This suggests that the PD prodromal stage may have seen this alteration. Furthermore, functional analysis indicated that these distinctive microbiota and metabolites were primarily associated with phenylalanine metabolism and vitamin B6 metabolism. Basic experiments and multi-center, large-cohort clinical researches are worth conducting to confirm this, since they may offer insights for treating individuals with PD-RBD.

## 207. Gut microbiota-derived indoleacetic acid attenuates neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in glaucoma through ahr/rage pathway.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders through regulation of neuroinflammatory responses, while its role in optic nerve degeneration remains incompletely characterized. This study elucidates the neuroprotective role of gut microbiota derived tryptophan metabolites in glaucoma through gut-eye communication and inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. METHODS: Gut microbiota profiling (16 S rRNA sequencing) and serum indoleacetic acid (IAA) quantification were performed in glaucoma patients versus controls. Microbiota-metabolite relationships were further validated through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). The neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effect of Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) and IAA was assessed in both microbead-induced ocular hypertension mice model and in vitro BV-2 microglial cell inflammation model via immunofluorescence, qPCR, Western blot and mice behavioral assays. To explore the underlying mechanisms, retinal transcriptomics and microglia-neuron co-cultures were also employed. RESULT: Glaucoma patients exhibited gut dysbiosis characterized by depleted tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria (B. fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Anaerostipes hadrus) and reduced serum IAA levels. Mice receiving FMT from glaucoma patients exhibited lower systemic IAA levels. In in vivo and in vitro models, B. fragilis or IAA restored AhR activation, suppressed inflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators throughout the retina, reduced retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) loss and preserved visual function. Mechanistically, IAA attenuated RAGE/NF-κB pathway activation via AhR-dependent signaling, conferring neuroprotection. CONCLUSION: Our study proposes a novel AhR-mediated gut microbiota-eye axis in glaucoma pathogenesis and demonstrates that IAA serves as an effective neuroprotective strategy with clinical potential for managing RGCs neurodegeneration.

## 208. Assessment of the Gut Microbiome in Patients with Coexisting Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

Background: The gut microbiome is a key modulator of the gut–brain axis and may contribute to the pathophysiology of both gastrointestinal and systemic disorders. This study aimed to evaluate gut microbiota composition and tryptophan/phenylalanine metabolism in women with unclassified irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-U), with or without coexisting chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Methods: Eighty women were enrolled and divided into two groups: IBS-U without CFS (Group I, n = 40) and IBS-U with coexisting CFS (Group II, n = 40). Microbial composition and diversity were assessed using the GA-map™ Dysbiosis Test, including the dysbiosis index (DI) and Shannon Diversity Index (SDI). Hydrogen and methane levels were measured in breath samples. Urinary concentrations of selected microbial and neuroactive metabolites—homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), xanthurenic acid (XA), quinolinic acid (QA), hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA), and 3-indoxyl sulfate (3-IS)—were quantified using LC-MS/MS. Fatigue severity was assessed using the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ-11) and the fatigue severity scale (FSS). Results: Compared to Group I, patients with IBS-CFS showed significantly greater microbial diversity, higher breath methane levels, and elevated urinary concentrations of QA, XA, 3-IS, and HVA, alongside lower concentrations of 5-HIAA and KYN. Fatigue severity was positively correlated with urinary XA and QA levels. Conclusions: Women with IBS and coexisting CFS exhibit distinct gut microbiota and tryptophan metabolite profiles compared to those without fatigue. The observed metabolite–symptom associations, particularly involving neuroactive kynurenine derivatives, warrant further investigation. These preliminary findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating and require validation through high-resolution microbiome analyses, functional pathway profiling, and longitudinal or interventional studies to clarify causality and clinical significance.

## 209. State of omics-based microbial diagnostics of CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major burden of cancer-related morbidity and mortality globally, especially when detected at later stages. Early detection through improved and more accessible diagnostics is critical for reducing the severity of CRC. As our understanding of CRC and the microbial inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract continues to improve, it has become increasingly recognized that the bacterial component of the gut microbiome may provide diagnostic utility for detecting CRC. This is because CRC is often accompanied by shifts in bacterial taxa, and the metabolites produced or utilized by the CRC-associated gut bacterial community. Advances in sequencing and metabolite profiling technologies paired with our growing understanding of CRC-associated microbial taxa, present an opportunity for new gut microbiome-based diagnostics. In this narrative review, we discuss bacterial taxa and gut metabolites that have been investigated as predictive features for CRC diagnosis. We aim to highlight the tremendous progress that has been made in identifying gut microbiome-based features and why they should be further explored as potential CRC diagnostics. We also identify challenges that future work must address, including the impact of patient lifestyle, variation in methodology, and nonstandard data management practices. Resolving these areas of study design and implementation is key to understanding the complex bacterial communities and their by-products associated with CRC, and the development of microbial diagnostics that can detect them.

## 210. Intermittent fasting and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: the potential role of the gut-liver axis.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing public health concern linked to the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). MASLD remains a significant clinical challenge due to the absence of effective therapeutic interventions. Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological strategy for managing MASLD. Although the exact mechanisms underpinning the possible beneficial effects of IF on MASLD are not yet fully elucidated, the gut microbiota and its metabolic byproducts are increasingly recognized as potential mediators of these effects. The gut-liver axis may act as an important conduit through which IF exerts its beneficial influence on hepatic function. This review comprehensively examines the impact of various IF protocols on gut microbiota composition, investigating the resultant alterations in microbial diversity and metabolomic profiles, and their potential implications for liver health and the improvement of MASLD.

## 211. Gut Microbiota in Heart Failure-The Role of Inflammation.

Heart failure (HF) has become an immense health concern affecting almost 1-2% of the population globally. It is a complex syndrome characterized by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone (RAAS) axis as well as endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The recent literature points towards the interaction between the intestinal flora and the heart, also called the gut-heart axis. The human gastrointestinal tract is naturally inhabited by various microbes, which are distinct for each patient, regulating the functions of many organs. Alterations of the gut microbiome, a process called dysbiosis, may result in systemic diseases and have been associated with heart failure through inflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms. The disorder of intestinal permeability favors the translocation of microbes and many metabolites capable of inducing inflammation, thus further contributing to the deterioration of normal cardiac function. Besides diet modifications and exercise training, many studies have revealed possible gut microbiota targeted treatments for managing heart failure. The aim of this review is to demonstrate the impact of the inflammatory environment induced by the gut microbiome and its metabolites on heart failure and the elucidation of these novel therapeutic approaches.

## 212. Impact of gut microbiota on colorectal anastomotic healing (Review).

Intestinal anastomosis is a critical procedure in both emergency and elective surgeries to maintain intestinal continuity. However, the incidence of anastomotic leakage (AL) has recently increased, reaching up to 20%, imposing major clinical and economic burdens. Substantial perioperative alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition may contribute to AL, particularly due to disruptions in key microbial populations essential for intestinal health and healing. The intricate interplay between the intestinal microbiota and the host immune system, along with microbial changes before and during surgery, significantly influences anastomotic integrity. Notably, specific pathogens such as Enterococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been implicated in AL pathogenesis. Preventive strategies including dietary regulation, personalized intestinal preparation, microbiota restoration and enhanced recovery after surgery protocols, may mitigate AL risks. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms linking intestinal microbiota alterations to anastomotic healing and developing targeted interventions to improve surgical outcomes.

## 213. Impacts of microbiome metabolites on immune regulation and autoimmunity.

A vast number of studies have demonstrated a remarkable role for the gut microbiota and their metabolites in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, have revealed that modifying certain intestinal bacterial populations may influence immune cell priming in the periphery, resulting in dysregulation of immune responses and neuroinflammatory processes in the central nervous system (CNS). Conversely, some commensal bacteria and their antigenic products can protect against inflammation within the CNS. Specific components of the gut microbiome have been implicated in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent generation of Th17 cells. Similarly, commensal bacteria and their metabolites can also promote the generation of regulatory T-cells (Treg), contributing to immune suppression. Short-chain fatty acids may induce Treg either by G-protein-coupled receptors or inhibition of histone deacetylases. Tryptophan metabolites may suppress inflammatory responses by acting on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in T-cells or astrocytes. Interestingly, secretion of these metabolites can be impaired by excess consumption of dietary components, such as long-chain fatty acids or salt, indicating that the diet represents an environmental factor affecting the complex crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the immune system. This review discusses new aspects of host-microbiota interaction and the immune system with a special focus on MS as a prototype T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the CNS.

## 214. Gut inflammation promotes microbiota-specific CD4 T cell-mediated neuroinflammation.

The microbiota has been recognized as a critical contributor to various diseases<sup>1</sup>, with multiple reports of changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in contexts such as inflammatory bowel disease<sup>2,3</sup> and neurodegenerative diseases<sup>4</sup>. These microbial shifts can exert systemic effects by altering the release of specific metabolites into the bloodstream<sup>5,6</sup>, and the gastrointestinal microbiota has also been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory activity through the activation of innate and adaptive immunity<sup>7,8</sup>. However, it remains unclear how the microbiota contributes to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), where these microorganisms are typically absent. Here we report that T cells that recognize gut-colonizing segmented filamentous bacteria can induce inflammation in the mouse intestine and CNS in the absence of functional regulatory T cells. Gut commensal-specific CD4 T cells (T<sub>comm</sub> cells) that are dysregulated in the inflamed gut can become licensed to infiltrate into the CNS regardless of their antigen specificity and have the potential to be re-stimulated by host protein-derived antigens in the CNS via molecular mimicry, whereupon they produce high levels of GM-CSF, IFNγ and IL-17A, triggering neurological damage. These infiltrated T<sub>comm</sub> cells initiate CNS inflammation by activating microglia through their IL-23R-dependent encephalitogenic programme and their IL-23R-independent GM-CSF production. Together, our findings reveal potential mechanisms whereby perturbation of T<sub>comm</sub> cells can contribute to extraintestinal inflammation.

## 215. Novelties on Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease-Focus on Gut and Oral Microbiota Involvement.

Recent studies underscore the role of gut and oral microbiota in influencing neuroinflammation through the microbiota-gut-brain axis, including in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of recent findings on the involvement of gut and oral microbiota in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with AD, emphasizing novel insights and therapeutic implications. This review reveals that dysbiosis in AD patients' gut and oral microbiota is linked to heightened peripheral and central inflammatory responses. Specific bacterial taxa, such as Bacteroides and Firmicutes in the gut, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis in the oral cavity, are notably altered in AD, leading to significant changes in microglial activation and cytokine production. Gut microbiota alterations are associated with increased intestinal permeability, facilitating the translocation of endotoxins like lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the bloodstream and exacerbating neuroinflammation by activating the brain's toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathways. Furthermore, microbiota-derived metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and amyloid peptides, can cross the blood-brain barrier and modulate neuroinflammatory responses. While microbial amyloids may contribute to amyloid-beta aggregation in the brain, certain SCFAs like butyrate exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue to mitigate neuroinflammation. This review not only highlights the critical role of microbiota in AD pathology but also offers a ray of hope by suggesting that modulating gut and oral microbiota could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing neuroinflammation and slowing disease progression.

## 216. Therapeutic Horizons: Gut Microbiome, Neuroinflammation, and Epigenetics in Neuropsychiatric Disorders.

Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of many neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD), which are among the leading causes of disability worldwide. Emerging evidence highlights the significant role of the gut microbiota (GM)-immune system-brain axis in neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of NPD, primarily through epigenetic mechanisms. Gut microbes and their metabolites influence immune cell activity and brain function, thereby contributing to neuroinflammation and the development and progression of NPD. The enteric nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine signaling, and the immune system all participate in bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. Importantly, the interaction of each of these systems with the GM influences epigenetic pathways. Here, we first explore the intricate relationship among intestinal microbes, microbial metabolites, and immune cell activity, with a focus on epigenetic mechanisms involved in NPD pathogenesis. Next, we provide background information on the association between inflammation and epigenetic aberrations in the context of NPD. Additionally, we review emerging therapeutic strategies-such as prebiotics, probiotics, methyl-rich diets, ketogenic diet, and medications-that may modulate the GM-immune system-brain axis via epigenetic regulation for the prevention or treatment of NPD. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in investigating the critical role of this axis in mental health.

## 217. The gut-microbiota-brain axis: Focus on gut steroids.

There are over 1000 varieties of steroids that have been reported in nature, including the endogenous sex steroid hormones (i.e., progesterone, testosterone, and 17β-estradiol) and corticosteroids which are mainly synthesized by gonads and adrenals, respectively. In addition, an extra-glandular steroidogenesis has been also reported in the brain and in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The reason why intestinal steroidogenesis and consequently gut steroids draw our attention is for the communication and interaction with the gut microbiota, which functions like a virtual endocrine organ, and it is also involved in the steroid production. Moreover, both GIT and gut microbiota communicate through neural, endocrine, and humoral ways with the brain, in the so-called gut-microbiota-brain axis. On this basis, in this review, we will discuss several aspects such as (1) intestinal steroidogenesis and its possible regulation, (2) the potential role of gut steroids in physiopathological conditions, and (3) the role of microbiome in steroidogenesis and steroid metabolism. Overall, this review highlights new points of view considering steroid molecules as potential therapeutic approach for gastrointestinal disorders and brain comorbidities.

## 218. The gut microbiome and metabolomic alterations underlying colitis-induced encephalopathy in mice: mechanistic insight.

BACKGROUND: In addition to classical gastrointestinal symptoms, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often exhibit neurological manifestations, such as mood disorders and cognitive dysfunctions, which are frequently overlooked. However, the potential pathogenesis of IBD-related encephalopathy remains unclear, and few studies have explored the influence of interactions between the gut microbiota and the host gut-brain metabolome on the emergence of brain diseases in IBD mice. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of gut microbiome and metabolome alterations in dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced IBD mice compared to control mice, focusing on colonic contents and hippocampal tissue. Our aim was to investigate the putative mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis in IBD-induced encephalopathy. RESULTS: IBD mice showed depression-like behaviors and cognitive deficits. Metabolic profiling revealed distinct patterns in the colonic contents and hippocampal areas of IBD mice, marked by decreased energy metabolism, amino acid levels, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and choline metabolism. These metabolic changes were negatively associated with the abundance of Bacteroides, Turicibacter, Ruminococcus, and Akkermansia, while Desulfovibrio and Lactobacillus showed positive correlations. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies unique microbial and gut-brain metabolite signatures associated with DSS-induced changes and offers new metabolic insights into the microbiota-gut-brain axis in IBD-related brain disorders. It highlights the potential of targeting gut microbiota to modulate host metabolism as a therapeutic approach for IBD-related neurological complications.

## 219. Unveiling the Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Antidepressants: A Systematic Review of Human Studies over the Last Decade.

Background/Objectives: Depression ranks among the most prevalent mental health conditions globally, marked by a variety of symptoms that frequently cause significant emotional distress and impairment in individuals, alongside a high recurrence rate. The predominant approach to treating depression revolves around monoamine theory, utilizing SSRIs and SNRIs, with Esketamine emerging as a supplementary option in recent times. Nevertheless, there is a growing focus on exploring the relationship between inflammation and depression, revealing a strong correlation between the two. This insight prompts consideration of the anti-inflammatory properties of current antidepressants in their therapeutic application. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed database to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical trials (CTs) that assessed the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of SSRIs (fluoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, and paroxetine), the SNRI venlafaxine, and esketamine/ketamine in human subjects undergoing treatment for depression. The included studies were evaluated based on changes in levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers in response to the antidepressant treatments. Results: SSRIs, SNRIs, esketamine, and ketamine (a racemic mixture of S- and R-ketamine not formally approved for the treatment of depression) exhibit anti-inflammatory effects through diverse mechanisms, such as reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines or enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines in serum or within specific brain regions like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These actions are mediated through various inflammatory pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), the brain Nod-like receptor pyrin-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, the glutamatergic system, the gut-brain axis, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, impaired neuroplasticity, and the kynurenine pathway. Conclusions: In summary, SSRIs, SNRIs, esketamine, and ketamine exert an anti-inflammatory role alongside their antidepressant effects via these intricate mechanisms.

## 220. Integrative review of the gut microbiome's role in pain management for orthopaedic conditions.

The gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms, has a significant role in modulating pain, particularly within orthopaedic conditions. Its impact on immune and neurological functions is underscored by the gut-brain axis, which influences inflammation, pain perception, and systemic immune responses. This integrative review examines current research on how gut dysbiosis is associated with various pain pathways, notably nociceptive and neuroinflammatory mechanisms linked to central sensitization. We highlight advancements in meta-omics technologies, such as metagenomics and metaproteomics, which deepen our understanding of microbiome-host interactions and their implications in pain. Recent studies emphasize that gut-derived short-chain fatty acids and microbial metabolites play roles in modulating neuroinflammation and nociception, contributing to pain management. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and faecal microbiome transplants are explored as potential therapeutic strategies to alleviate pain through gut microbiome modulation, offering an adjunct or alternative to opioids. However, variability in individual microbiomes poses challenges to standardizing these treatments, necessitating further rigorous clinical trials. A multidisciplinary approach combining microbiology, immunology, neurology, and orthopaedics is essential to develop innovative, personalized pain management strategies rooted in gut health, with potential to transform orthopaedic pain care.

## 221. Polyphenol Microbial Metabolites Exhibit Gut and Blood⁻Brain Barrier Permeability and Protect Murine Microglia against LPS-Induced Inflammation.

Increasing evidence supports the beneficial effects of polyphenol-rich diets, including the traditional Mediterranean diet, for the management of cardiovascular disease, obesity and neurodegenerative diseases. However, a common concern when discussing the protective effects of polyphenol-rich diets against diseases is whether these compounds are present in systemic circulation in their intact/parent forms in order to exert their beneficial effects in vivo. Here, we explore two common classes of dietary polyphenols, namely isoflavones and lignans, and their gut microbial-derived metabolites for gut and blood-brain barrier predicted permeability, as well as protection against neuroinflammatory stimuli in murine BV-2 microglia. Polyphenol microbial metabolites (PMMs) generally showed greater permeability through artificial gut and blood-brain barriers compared to their parent compounds. The parent polyphenols and their corresponding PMMs were evaluated for protective effects against lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in BV-2 microglia. The lignan-derived PMMs, equol and enterolactone, exhibited protective effects against nitric oxide production, as well as against pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in BV-2 microglia. Therefore, PMMs may contribute, in large part, to the beneficial effects attributed to polyphenol-rich diets, further supporting the important role of gut microbiota in human health and disease prevention.

## 222. Effect of Clostridium butyricum against Microglia-Mediated Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease via Regulating Gut Microbiota and Metabolites Butyrate.

Recent evidences demonstrate that abnormal gut microbiota (GM) might be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of probiotics in preventing AD by regulating GM-gut-brain axis remains unclear. Here, the anti-neuroinflammatory effect and its mechanism of probiotic Clostridium butyricum (CB) against AD is investigated by regulating GM-gut-brain axis.

## 223. The Role of Gut Microbiota in Pediatric Obesity and Metabolic Disorders: Insights from a Comprehensive Review.

Background: Pediatric obesity represents a multifactorial condition in which gut microbiota dysbiosis, low-grade systemic inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction are intricately connected. Objectives: This systematic review sought to evaluate and integrate current findings regarding the interactions between gut microbial composition, dietary influences, inflammatory status, and metabolic outcomes in obese pediatric populations. Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted for studies published from January 2010 onward. Eligible studies comprised randomized controlled trials, and cohort, cross-sectional, and longitudinal designs involving individuals aged ≤18 years. Study quality was appraised using the NIH Study Quality Assessment Tool. Results: Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Dysbiosis was consistently observed among obese children, characterized by alterations in microbial diversity and abundance associated with increased inflammation and adverse metabolic profiles. Dietary interventions, notably symbiotic supplementation and adherence to Mediterranean diet patterns, were associated with favorable modulation of gut microbiota and inflammatory parameters. The majority of studies demonstrated high methodological quality, although minor observational limitations were noted. Conclusions: Gut microbiota dysregulation plays a central role in the development of metabolic and inflammatory complications associated with pediatric obesity. Although dietary and microbiota-modifying strategies show therapeutic promise, their effectiveness must be substantiated through robust, long-term studies.

## 224. Inflammatory links between epilepsy and depression: a review of mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity of epilepsy. While antiseizure medications (ASMs) can exacerbate depressive symptoms, depression itself may increase both the frequency and duration of epileptic seizures. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying epilepsy-depression comorbidity (EDC) involve neurotransmitter imbalance, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress (OS), gut microbiota dysbiosis, and neuroendocrine abnormalities. Recent studies highlight that inflammation contributes to EDC via multiple interconnected mechanisms, including glial cell activation, cytokine release, pyroptosis, and oxidative damage, ultimately leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuroimmune imbalance. Drawing from representative and recent evidence, this review summarizes the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of EDC. It also outlines current inflammation-targeted therapeutic strategies, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants, herbal medicine, acupuncture, probiotic modulation, and precision therapies. This review provides a conceptual framework for understanding inflammation-mediated EDC and offers insights into targeted treatment approaches.

## 225. Microbiota-derived metabolite Indoles induced aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation and inhibited neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice.

Gut microbiota alterations might affect the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through microbiota-derived metabolites. For example, microbiota-derived Indoles via tryptophan metabolism prevented Aβ accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation, restored synaptic plasticity, and then promoted the cognitive and behavioral ability of APP/PS1 mice. The imbalanced compositions of Indoles-producing bacteria with tryptophan deficiency were found in male APP/PS1 mice, but the molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Our current study revealed that Indoles (including indole, indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-propionic acid) upregulated the production of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), inhibited the activation of the NF-κB signal pathway as well as the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced the release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-18, alleviating the inflammatory response of APP/PS1 mice. These findings demonstrated the roles of Indoles-producing bacteria in activating the AhR pathway to regulate neuroinflammation of AD through gut microbiota-derived Indoles, which implied a novel way for AD treatment.

## 226. The role of interleukin-17 in neurological disorders.

In recent years, the intricate relationship between the immune system and neurological disorders has garnered significant attention. While the central nervous system had long been perceived as immunologically privileged, emerging research has revealed complex interactions among immune cells, inflammatory mediators, and neural components that collectively influence the pathogenesis and progression of various neurological disorders. This comprehensive review explores the crucial role of the cytokine interleukin-17(IL-17) in neurological diseases. It examines the complex contributions of IL-17 to both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its diverse mechanisms and its impact on neuro-immune crosstalk. Moreover, we assess the evidence supporting the potential therapeutic role of modulating IL-17, considering its beneficial and detrimental effects. Through a comprehensive analysis of current research, we aim to provide insights into the modulatory role of IL-17 in neurological disorders.

## 227. Gut-brain connection in schizophrenia: A narrative review.

Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive, emotional, and behavioral impairments. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is crucial in its pathophysiology, mediating communication between the gut and brain through neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in gut microbiota, is linked to neuroinflammation, systemic inflammation, and neurotransmitter disruptions, all of which contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, influence brain function, including immune responses and neurotransmitter synthesis. These findings suggest that microbial imbalances exacerbate schizophrenia, providing a novel perspective on the disorder's underlying mechanisms. Emerging microbiota-targeted therapies-such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation-show promise as adjunctive treatments, aiming to restore microbial balance and improve clinical outcomes. While further research is needed, targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis offers an innovative approach to schizophrenia management, with the potential to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.

## 228. Research Progress on Inflammation and Immune Dysregulation in PTSD.

INTRODUCTION: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychological condition triggered by traumatic events, commonly characterized by symptoms such as re-experiencing traumatic memories, avoidance, hyperarousal, and disturbances in cognition and emotions. While PTSD is often viewed through a psychological lens, increasing evidence highlights its strong association with immune system dysfunction and inflammation. This narrative review summarizes recent research progress on the role of inflammation and immune dysregulation in PTSD, highlighting key findings and their implications for understanding the pathophysiology of the disorder. METHODS: We conducted a search in the PubMed and Web of Science databases using the keywords "PTSD" and "related inflammatory markers" and discussed the existing literature on the relationship between PTSD and inflammatory responses. RESULTS: The research indicates that PTSD is marked by significant imbalances in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines across various biological fluids, including blood, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid. Abnormal immune cell activation and elevated levels of soluble adhesion molecules, chemokines, and markers of inflammation were frequently observed in PTSD patients. These inflammatory responses are accompanied by aberrant activity in central immune cells, suggesting that inflammation may play a key role in the pathogenesis of PTSD. In addition, neuroinflammatory processes were linked to cognitive and emotional disturbances commonly seen in individuals with PTSD. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that immune system dysfunction and inflammation are integral components of PTSD pathology. Understanding the mechanisms of neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation could facilitate the early identification of individuals at high risk for PTSD and pave the way for inflammation-targeted therapies. Future research should focus on developing novel anti-inflammatory interventions to complement existing therapeutic approaches, potentially offering new avenues for precision treatment strategies for PTSD.

## 229. Immune cells in Alzheimer's disease: insights into pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder for which there are currently no effective treatment options. Increasing evidence suggests that AD is a systemic disease closely associated with the immune system, not merely a central nervous system (CNS) disorder. Immune cells play crucial roles in the onset and progression of AD. Microglia and astrocytes are the primary inflammatory cells in the brain that can sensitively detect changes in the internal environment and transform into different phenotypes to exert differing effects at various stages of AD. Peripheral immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils can also be recruited to the CNS to mediate the inflammatory response in AD. As such, investigating the role of immune cells in AD is particularly important for elucidating its specific pathogenesis. This review primarily discusses the roles of central innate immune cells, peripheral immune cells, and the interactions between central and peripheral immune cells in the development of neuroinflammation in AD. Furthermore, we listed clinical trials targeting AD-associated neuroinflammation, which may represent a promising direction for developing effective treatments for AD in the future.

## 230. From nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to neuroinflammation: the role of chronic systemic inflammation.

Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor to neurological disorders. While previous research has mainly concentrated on lesions within the brain, the potential influence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on neuroinflammation has been largely overlooked. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that heightened chronic systemic inflammation linked to NAFLD could significantly contribute to the initiation and advancement of neuroinflammation, nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This review summarizes the primary causes of chronic systemic inflammation in the context of NAFLD, delineates the mechanisms by which chronic systemic inflammation leads to neuroinflammation, analyzes the key pathways through which circulating inflammatory mediators travel from the periphery to the central nervous system and their effects on glial cells, and finally discusses the novel approaches for treating neuroinflammation via a liver-brain inflammation axis perspective. This research intends to offer an in-depth insight into how chronic systemic inflammation contributes to the connection between NAFLD and neuroinflammation.

## 231. Inflammation and depression: an evolutionary framework for the role of physical activity and exercise.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a leading global health challenge, affecting nearly 5% of the population. Mounting evidence suggests that systemic low-grade chronic inflammation (SLGCI) plays a central role in the development and progression of MDD. This persistent inflammatory state results from unresolved immune activation and sustained exposure to modern lifestyle factors, such as sedentary behavior, poor diet, inadequate sleep, and psychological stress. Regular physical activity (PA), particularly exercise, has been shown to modulate inflammatory processes and improve depressive symptoms. This narrative review examines the complex interactions between inflammation and MDD, focusing on the role of PA and exercise in mitigating SLGCI and neuroinflammation. This is approached through an evolutionary lens, exploring how the mismatch between ancestral and modern activity levels may contribute to the rise of MDD. In addition, it highlights the potential risks of excessive exercise, including overtraining and its association with depressive symptoms. Finally, this work proposes a practical framework for optimizing PA and exercise as preventive and therapeutic tools for MDD by aligning modern PA patterns with ancestral behavioral norms.

## 232. The early-life gut microbiome in common pediatric diseases: roles and therapeutic implications.

The early-life gut microbiome has been increasingly recognized as a contributing factor for pediatric health and diseases. Studies have reported that the human gut microbiota colonization commences at birth and progresses over the course of the first three years of life, until it reaches a mature and stable diversity and composition. During this critical window, the gut microbiome is vulnerably subjected to environmental factors, leading to transient microbial reprogramming and functional changes. The dynamic early-life intestinal microbiota is frequently manipulated by environmental factors, which impact the composition and function of the gut microflora, hence confer to short-and/or long-term health outcomes extending to adulthood. Evidence has shown that the imbalanced gut microbial community early in life is associated with several childhood diseases and disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, allergies, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and pediatric obesity. Manipulating the early-life intestinal microbes can either ameliorate or impair host's immunological and metabolic responses, impacting overall health conditions later in life. This narrative review article discusses the recent understanding and implications of the early-life gut microbiome in common pediatric diseases and potential intervention approaches.

## 233. Microglial mitophagy integrates the microbiota-gut-brain axis to restrain neuroinflammation during neurotropic herpesvirus infection.

Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), is a severe central nervous system disease commonly followed by cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, and focal neurological signs. Although increasing evidence implicates the central role of microglia in HSE progression, the intrinsic restrictors or the acquired environmental factors that balance the beneficial or detrimental immune responses in microglia remain unclear. In a recent study, we find that a gut microbial metabolite activates mitophagy to regulate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and to mitigate HSE progression. HSV-1 neurotropic infection causes gut microbiota dysbiosis and microglial antiviral immune response, whereas depletion of gut microbiota by oral antibiotics treatment further results in hyperactivated microglia and exacerbated HSE pathology. Notably, exogenous administration of nicotinamide n-oxide (NAMO), an oxidative product of nicotinamide mainly produced by intestinal neomycin-sensitive bacteria, especially Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus reuteri, can significantly suppress HSE progression. Mechanistically, HSV-1 infection causes mitochondrial dysfunction and impairs mitophagy to activate microglia and promote proinflammatory cytokine production, whereas NAMO restores NAD+-dependent mitophagy to restrain microglial over-activation and to prevent HSV-1 early infection in neuronal cells. This work reveals a novel function of gut microbial metabolites as intrinsic regulators of microglia homeostasis and neuroinflammation via mitophagy.<b>Abbreviations:</b> AD: Alzheimer disease; ABX: antibiotics; HSE: herpes simplex encephalitis; HSV-1: herpes simplex virus type 1; NAD<sup>+</sup>: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NAMO: nicotinamide n-oxide; SCFAs: short-chain fatty acids.

## 234. Gut-vitamin D interplay: key to mitigating immunosenescence and promoting healthy ageing.

BACKGROUND: Immunosenescence is the loss and change of immunological organs, as well as innate and adaptive immune dysfunction with ageing, which can lead to increased sensitivity to infections, age-related diseases, and cancer. Emerging evidence highlights the role of gut-vitamin D axis in the regulation of immune ageing, influencing chronic inflammation and systemic health. This review aims to explore the interplay between the gut microbiota and vitamin D in mitigating immunosenescence and preventing against chronic inflammation and age-related diseases. MAIN TEXT: Gut microbiota dysbiosis and vitamin D insufficiency accelerate immunosenescence and risk of chronic diseases. Literature data reveal that vitamin D modulates gut microbiota diversity and composition, enhances immune resilience, and reduce systemic inflammation. Conversely, gut microbiota influences vitamin D metabolism to promote the synthesis of active vitamin D metabolites with implications for immune health. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential of targeting gut-vitamin D axis to modulate immune responses, delay the immune ageing, and mitigate age-related diseases. Further research is needed to integrate vitamin D supplementation and microbiome modulation into strategies aimed at promoting healthy ageing.

## 235. Leptin and inflammatory pathways in the Alzheimer's disease continuum: Implications for glial activation and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic peripheral inflammation triggered by adipokine release may extend to the brain, potentially influencing the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). However, it remains unclear whether and how leptin contributes to the link between adipose tissue dysfunction and dementia. This study aims to investigate the role of leptin in the connection between adipose-derived inflammatory signaling and cognitive impairment/NPS. METHODS: Path analysis was employed to explore how leptin relates to the association between adipose-related metabolic dysfunction and dementia through inflammatory pathways in patients with AD pathology (n = 15). Variables included plasma leptin concentration, body mass index (BMI) as a marker of adiposity, and in vivo assessments of regional neuroinflammation using translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with the tracer (11)C-DPA-713 ((11)C-DPA-713-binding potential [(11)C-DPA-713-BP(ND)]). Cognitive function was measured using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Japanese Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-J cog), while NPS were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). RESULTS: Regression analysis demonstrated that higher plasma leptin concentrations positively correlated with BMI and significantly predicted (11)C-DPA-713-BP(ND) in the insula. Additionally, NPI-Q scores were associated with (11)C-DPA-713-BP(ND) in the insula. Path analysis supported leptin's role linking adiposity to NPS through insular inflammation. The hypothesized model fit the data well under the null hypothesis [χ(2) (3) = 0.63, p = 0.89]. DISCUSSION: These findings underscore the relevance of exploring how leptin and adipose tissue dysfunction interact with neuroinflammatory processes in contributing to NPS in the patients in the AD continuum. Interventions targeting these interactions could represent promising avenues for managing NPS.

## 236. Gut microbiota has the potential to improve health of menopausal women by regulating estrogen.

Menopause is an age-related loss of ovarian function. As a woman enters menopause, the estrogen produced by her ovaries decreases, which will adversely affect women's health. The symptoms related to menopause are related to the imbalance of gut microbiota. Studies have shown that the diversity of gut microbiota after menopause is lower than that before menopause, and the weakening of microbial decomposition will lead to the decrease of circulating estrogen, gradually resulting in disorders of lipid metabolism, cognitive decline, osteoporosis and other diseases. Gut microbiota play a key role in regulating estrogen levels. By secreting β-glucuronidase, it increases the reabsorption of estrogen in the enterohepatic circulation and mediates phytoestrogen metabolism, regulates estrogen homeostasis in the host and affects disease development and prognosis. Therefore, the gut microbiota is an overall regulator of women's estrogen status during menopause and an untapped new area for improving women's postmenopausal health. Changing the gut microbiota through specific prebiotics, probiotics, etc., and then affecting estrogen levels provides exciting opportunities for future therapeutic applications.

## 237. Microglial intervention in ischemic stroke: Roles and intervention strategies.

Ischemic stroke is a major cause of neurological deficits and high disability rate. As the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, microglia play dual roles in neuroinflammation and tissue repair following a stroke. Their dynamic activation and polarization states are key factors that influence the disease process and treatment outcomes. This review article investigates the role of microglia in ischemic stroke and explores potential intervention strategies. Microglia exhibit a dynamic functional state, transitioning between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. This duality is crucial in ischemic stroke, as it maintains a balance between neuroinflammation and tissue repair. Activated microglia contribute to neuroinflammation through cytokine release and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, while simultaneously promoting tissue repair through anti-inflammatory responses and regeneration. Key pathways influencing microglial activation include Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinases, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathways. These pathways are targets for various experimental therapies aimed at promoting M2 polarization and mitigating damage. Potential therapeutic agents include natural compounds found in drugs such as minocycline, as well as traditional Chinese medicines. Drugs that target these regulatory mechanisms, such as small molecule inhibitors and components of traditional Chinese medicines, along with emerging technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, offer new therapeutic strategies and clinical translational potential for ischemic stroke.

## 238. Mild Chronic Colitis Exacerbates Intracerebral Inflammation in Mice with Parkinson's Disease Through LRRK2-Mediated Regulation of NF-κB Activation and Inhibition of Nrf2.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a known risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a protein associated with both disease, regulates inflammation in the colon and brain. However, the precise mechanism by which LRRK2 mediates the crosstalk between intestinal inflammation and PD neuropathology remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate how LRRK2 mediates the inflammatory response in both the gut and brain. METHODS: A dual-hit (DSS+MPTP) mouse model was established to induce IBD and PD, along with separate single DSS-induced colitis and MPTP-induced PD models. LRRK2 expression was analyzed in the colon and striatum. Intestinal barrier integrity (ZO-1, Occludin), dopaminergic neuron loss and inflammation (TH, Iba-1 staining in SNpc/striatum), NF-κB and Nrf2 pathways activity, and levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and IL-10) in the colon and striatum was assessed. RESULTS: In the colon, LRRK2 expression was significantly increased in all experimental groups compared to the control, with the highest levels observed in the dual-hit group. The elevated LRRK2 expression correlated with the reduction in ZO-1 and Occludin levels and an increase in inflammatory cytokines IL1-β and TNF-α. A similar pattern of LRRK2 expression was observed in the brain. The dual-hit group exhibited increased Iba-1 expression and a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, the upregulation of LRRK2 was associated with NF-κB activation and Nrf2 inhibition in the brain. CONCLUSION: Mild chronic colitis induced by DSS may exacerbate brain inflammation in MPTP-induced PD mice by upregulating LRRK2 expression, leading to NF-κB activation and Nrf2 inhibition. We propose that LRRK2 may play a regulatory role in the NF- κB/Nrf2 interplay in PD.

## 239. Gut microbiome compositional and functional features associate with Alzheimer's disease pathology.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome is a potentially modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, understanding of its composition and function regarding AD pathology is limited. METHODS: Shallow-shotgun metagenomics was used to analyze the fecal microbiome of participants in the Wisconsin Microbiome in Alzheimer's Risk Study, leveraging clinical data and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Differential abundance and ordinary least squares regression analyses were performed to find differentially abundant gut microbiome features and their associations with CSF biomarkers of AD and related pathologies. RESULTS: Gut microbiome composition and function differed between individuals with and without AD dementia. The compositional difference was replicated in an independent cohort. Differentially abundant gut microbiome features were associated with CSF biomarkers of AD and related pathologies. DISCUSSION: These findings enhance our understanding of alterations in gut microbial composition and function in AD, and suggest that gut microbes and their pathways are linked to AD pathology. HIGHLIGHTS: Gut microbiome composition and function differ between people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. Co-occurring gut microbes show differential abundance across AD-related groups (AD vs CU, amyloid status+ vs amyloid status-, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status+ vs APOE ε4 status-). Gut microbiome composition also differs between people with AD dementia and CU individuals in a larger validation cohort. Differentially abundant gut microbiome composition and function between AD and CU groups are correlated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD and related pathologies.

## 240. Age- and Sex-Specific Gut Microbiota Signatures Associated with Dementia-Related Brain Pathologies: An LEfSe-Based Metagenomic Study.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota composition is influenced by both age and sex and may contribute to dementia-related brain pathologies. However, comprehensive microbiome-based biomarker discovery stratified by these factors remains limited. METHODS: We performed a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota of participants stratified by sex (female vs. male) and age (<75 vs. ≥75 years). Alpha diversity (observed operational taxonomic unit, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson) and linear discriminant analysis effect size analyses were conducted to identify dominant taxa associated with Alzheimer's pathology, vascular pathology, and dementia-related structural brain changes. RESULTS: Females and non-elderly participants (aged < 75 years) exhibited higher gut microbial diversity, characterized by an increased abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Blautia spp., whereas males and elderly participants (aged ≥ 75 years) exhibited increased levels of Bacteroides spp. and Bacteroidia, which have been associated with inflammation and dysbiosis. Several taxa, including Bifidobacterium spp. were consistently identified as potential protective biomarkers, while Bacteroides spp. was linked to a higher risk of dementia-related brain pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate distinct age- and sex-specific differences in gut microbiota composition that may be closely associated with the pathophysiology of dementia-related brain pathologies. These results demonstrate that gut microbiota may serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring cerebrovascular conditions, potentially contributing to the development of personalized therapeutic strategies.

## 241. Integrating gut microbiome and neuroplasticity genomics in alcohol use disorder therapy.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic neuropsychiatric condition with substantial public health impact. The interplay between gut microbiota and neuroplasticity-related genes presents a novel approach to understand AUD pathophysiology and treatment response. While microbial dysbiosis has been implicated in AUD, its correlation with gene expression changes in neuroplasticity pathways remains unexplored. This study investigates microbiome composition, microbial metabolic pathways, and their correlation with neuroplasticity-related genes in AUD patients undergoing treatment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study integrating gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequencing and host neuroplasticity-related gene expression profiling in AUD patients undergoing treatment which combines psychotherapeutic intervention along with oral diazepam administration followed by Pythagorean Self Awareness Intervention. Patients were classified as responders or non-responders, and microbial composition, functional pathways, and host-microbiota interactions were analyzed using multi-omic correlation frameworks. RESULTS: Responders exhibited a microbiome enriched in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g., Lachnospiraceae), linked to gut barrier integrity and neurotransmitter synthesis. In contrast, non-responders demonstrated enrichment of inflammation-associated taxa (Succinivibrionaceae) and oxidative stress-related metabolic pathways. Correlation analysis revealed microbiome-mediated modulation of neuroplasticity-related genes measured from peripheral blood, including BDNF, GRIA1, CAMK2G, and EGR family genes, suggesting a gut-brain-genomic axis in AUD treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the role of gut microbiota as a modulator of neuroplasticity-related gene expression in AUD patients. Integrating microbiome and host genomic signatures could improve biomarker-based prediction of treatment response and inform precision medicine approaches for AUD. Future studies should expand these findings by incorporating multi-omic approaches, including epigenomics and exposomics, to refine microbiome-targeted interventions for addiction therapy.

## 242. Viral immunological complications in neurological surgery: A comprehensive review of homeostatic disturbances and cognitive impairments.

BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical procedures are essential for treating various brain and spinal conditions, but they also carry the risk of infections, including viral infections. These infections can disrupt brain homeostasis, leading to cognitive impairments. During surgery, protective barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can be compromised, and cerebrospinal fluid may be exposed to pathogens. This makes the brain more susceptible to viral infections, which can trigger inflammation. Over time, this inflammation can have lasting effects on cognitive function, impacting the brain’s ability to maintain neural integrity. METHODS: A review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to January 2025. We focus on the impact of viral infections after neurosurgical procedures and how these infections lead to neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Viral infections after neurosurgery activate neuroinflammatory responses, with microglia and astrocytes playing a key role. The release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 causes significant neuronal damage, impairing synaptic function and connectivity. This inflammatory process, combined with BBB disruption, leads to cognitive dysfunction both in the immediate postoperative period and in the long-term. Understanding these processes is essential for addressing cognitive decline in patients who have undergone neurosurgery. CONCLUSION: Viral infections following neurosurgery are a significant risk factor for cognitive decline. Neuroinflammation, especially when coupled with BBB disruption, contributes to both short-term and long-term cognitive impairments. This review highlights the need for targeted interventions to control inflammation and protect the BBB in the perioperative period. Future research focused on neuroprotective therapies, including anti-inflammatory agents and strategies to preserve BBB integrity, is critical for improving cognitive outcomes in neurosurgical patients.

## 243. Macrophage Signaling Pathways in Health and Disease: From Bench to Bedside Applications.

Macrophages exhibit remarkable functional plasticity by dynamically polarizing into proinflammatory or antiinflammatory subsets in response to microenvironmental cues. This duality underpins their pivotal roles in immune defense, tissue homeostasis, and disease progression; however, the molecular mechanisms governing their polarization and crosstalk across various pathologies remain incompletely defined. This review systematically delineates macrophage biology, emphasizing the interplay between subset-specific signaling networks and their context-dependent activation in both health and disease. The heterogeneity of macrophages is characterized by detailing the distinctions between tissue-resident and monocyte-derived origins, as well as their polarization states. Core pathways regulating phagocytosis, tissue repair, immune modulation, and neuroprotection are dissected, along with their dysregulation in autoimmune disorders, neurodegeneration, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases. Notably, microenvironmental factors such as damage-associated molecular patterns, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and metabolic intermediates dynamically reshape macrophage phenotypes through NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-mediated transcriptional control. Preclinical and clinical evidence underscores potential therapeutic targets and emerging strategies. The significance of this review lies in its integrative analysis of signaling crosstalk, paradoxical pathway roles, and translational implications for precision therapies. These insights into macrophage functions and signaling pathways provide a robust foundation for future disease intervention and personalized medicine.

## 244. Gut Microbiota in a Viral Model of Multiple Sclerosis: Modulation and Pitfalls by Oral Antibiotic Treatment.

Viral infections have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), an immune-mediated disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Since Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) can induce MS-like demyelination, TMEV infection is the most widely used viral model for MS. Although the precise pathophysiology is unknown, altered fecal bacterial populations were associated with distinct immune gene expressions in the CNS. We aimed to determine the role of gut microbiota in TMEV infection by administering an antibiotic cocktail in drinking water before (prophylactic administration) or after (therapeutic administration) TMEV infection. The antibiotic administration reduced total eubacteria, including the phyla Bacillota and Bacteroidota, but increased the phylum Pseudomonadata in feces. Prophylactic administration did not alter TMEV-induced inflammatory demyelination clinically or histologically, without changes in anti-viral IgG1/IgG2c levels or lymphoproliferative responses; therapeutic administration temporarily suppressed the neurological signs. Although antibiotic treatment had minimal effects on TMEV infection, adding metronidazole and ampicillin in drinking water substantially reduced water intake in the antibiotic group of mice, resulting in significant body weight loss. Since dehydration and stress could affect immune responses and gut microbiota, caution should be exercised when planning or evaluating the oral antibiotic cocktail treatment in experimental animals.

## 245. Alleviating effects of probiotic supplementation on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in non-communicable diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis using the GRADE approach.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation and oxidative stress are key risk factors in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Probiotics have been suggested to be beneficial in mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress; however, the evidence remains inconsistent due to variations in study design, dosage, and patient populations. METHODS: Studies were included following a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE, provided they fulfilled the eligibility criteria. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to clarify the effects of probiotics on oxidative stress and inflammation in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). RESULTS: A review of 18 studies revealed that probiotic supplementation significantly reduced CRP (SMD = -1.33, 95% CI: -1.84, -0.82; p < 0.001, high certainty), TNF-α (SMD = -1.10, 95% CI: -1.66, -0.55; p < 0.001, low certainty), and MDA levels (SMD = -1.38, 95% CI: -2.08, -0.69; p < 0.001, high certainty). Additionally, while probiotics increased GSH levels (SMD = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.06, 1.23; p < 0.001, high certainty), they did not change the levels of IL-6 (SMD = -1.05, 95% CI: -2.21, 0.11; p < 0.001, low certainty), NO (SMD = 0.47, 95% CI: -0.54, 1.48; p = 0.363, low certainty) and TAC levels (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI: -0.27, 0.74; p = 0.357, moderate certainty). CONCLUSION: The supplementation of probiotics may have mitigated biomarkers associated with inflammation and oxidative stress.

## 246. Unraveling the Relation of Parkinson's Disease and Metabolites: A Combined Analysis of Stool and Plasma Metabolites Based on Untargeted Metabolomics Technology.

OBJECTIVE: Metabolomics technology has been widely utilized to uncover the action mechanisms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and to identify PD-related biomarkers. In this study, we compared plasma and fecal metabolite levels between PD patients and their healthy spouses (HS), aiming to identify the associations of differential metabolites with intestinal inflammation, intestinal barrier function, and clinical characteristics of PD. METHODS: Untargeted metabolomics techniques were used to characterize plasma and fecal metabolite profiles. We identified metabolites with elevated plasma levels in PD patients, while no significant differences were observed in fecal samples. Partial correlation analysis was employed to investigate the associations between these metabolites, markers of intestinal inflammation (calprotectin and lactoferrin), markers of intestinal permeability (α-1-antitrypsin and zonulin), and clinical characteristics of PD patients. RESULTS: The study identified ten metabolites that were significantly elevated in the plasma of PD patients compared to HS (p < 0.05), while their fecal concentrations did not differ significantly. Correlation analysis revealed that elevated levels of differential metabolites in the plasma of PD patients were associated with increased intestinal permeability and inflammation. Furthermore, five metabolites, including 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol O-sulfate and Propyl gallate, were linked to PD symptoms. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated that these metabolites could effectively distinguish between PD patients and HS, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94, indicating excellent predictive performance. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified significant metabolite alterations in PD patients and revealed their associations with intestinal barrier dysfunction and clinical characteristics of the disease.

## 247. Decoding mechanisms and protein markers in lung-brain axis.

BACKGROUND: The lung-brain axis represents a complex bidirectional communication network that is pivotal in the crosstalk between respiratory and neurological functions. This review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms and protein markers that mediate the effects of lung diseases on brain health. MAIN FINDINGS: In this review, we explore the mechanisms linking lung injury to neurocognitive impairments, focusing on neural pathways, immune regulation and inflammatory responses, microorganism pathways, and hypoxemia. Specifically, we highlight the role of the vagus nerve in modulating the central nervous system response to pulmonary stimuli; Additionally, the regulatory function of the immune system is underscored, with evidence suggesting that lung-derived immune mediators can traverse the blood-brain barrier, induce neuroinflammation and cognitive decline; Furthermore, we discuss the potential of lung microbiota to influence brain diseases through microbial translocation and immune activation; Finally, the impact of hypoxemia is examined, with findings indicating that it can exacerbate cerebral injury via oxidative stress and impaired perfusion. Moreover, we analyze how pulmonary conditions, such as pneumonia, ALI/ARDS, and asthma, contribute to neurological dysfunction. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can also contribute to cognitive impairment. Conversely, brain diseases (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury) can lead to acute respiratory complications. In addition, protein markers such as TLR4, ACE2, A-SAA, HMGB1, and TREM2 are crucial to the lung-brain axis and correlate with disease severity. We also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this axis, including immunomodulation and microbiome engineering. Overall, understanding the lung-brain interplay is crucial for developing integrated treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

## 248. Therapeutic potential of atorvastatin in ischemic stroke: an investigation into its anti-inflammatory effect by targeting the gut-brain axis.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted the vital role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Ischemic stroke (IS). However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of atorvastatin on IS via regulating gut-brain axis remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the relationship between atorvastatin, gut microbiota and IS through animal experiments, clinical trials and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: Male mice were induced with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) to establish an IS animal model, and then intragastrically treated with atorvastatin. Neurological deficits, microglia activation, and the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathway-related proteins were detected. Meanwhile, gut microbiota composition and intestinal barrier integrity were evaluated. In this prospective study, we recruited IS patients undergoing atorvastatin treatment, evaluated their functional outcomes, collected fecal samples, and assessed gut microbiota functions. Moreover, the causal relationships between specific bacteria, inflammation and IS were assessed via MR analysis. RESULTS: Our results showed that atorvastatin treatment significantly improved neurobehavioral deficits, suppressed activation of microglia, and inhibited NF-κB pathway as well as the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, reduced the release of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-18, which were reversed by antibiotics treatment. We further identified an increase in the genus Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 in atorvastatin-treated mice. Subsequent clinical experiments were conducted to explore the effects by analyzing the characteristic bacteria, such as Ruminococcus torques and Lachnospiraceae NK4A136. The higher abundances of Ruminococcus torques and Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 were associated with a good outcome in atorvastatin-treated IS patients. MR analysis further revealed that these microbes were negatively correlated with inflammatory factor levels, and showed inhibitory effects on the Akt/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway and PLA2G7 gene expression. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated the roles of atorvastatin in regulating Akt/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway to inhibit neuroinflammation through specific bacteria, which implied a novel way for IS treatment.

## 249. Longitudinal and Concurrent Changes in Brain and Gut due to Morphine Self-Administration.

Opioid agonists are known for their effects on the opioid and dopaminergic systems; however, new research points to complementary changes in the gut underlying maladaptive changes associated with opioid use. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional signaling process that permits feedback between the brain and gut and is altered in subjects with opioid use disorders, but the spatiotemporal correspondence between quantitative translational measures of gut and brain health is not clear. In this work, we determined longitudinal and concurrent changes in the brain and gut of rodents trained to self-administer morphine for 14 days. Active lever presses delivered a single infusion of morphine (0.4 mg/kg/infusion). We used MRI and 16s rDNA analysis of faecal matter to identify changes from baseline (naïve, nondrug state) to an acute phase (early in the self-administration process, after 2 days of self-administration) and a chronic phase (late in the self-administration process, after 14 days of self-administration). Animals were scanned in a 7T MRI scanner three times (baseline, acute and chronic), and before scanning, faecal matter was collected from each rat. We found early changes in gut microbiota diversity and specific abundance as early as the acute phase that persisted into the chronic phase. In MRI, we identified alterations in diffusivity indices both within subjects and between groups, showing a main effect in the striatum and thalamus. We posit that gut changes precede the effects observed in MRI, with the striatum and thalamus emerging as crucial links mediating communication between the gut and the brain.

## 250. Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: standing at the crossroad of lipid metabolism and immune response.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by macroscopic features such as cortical atrophy, narrowing of the gyri, widening of the sulci, and enlargement of the ventricles. At the cellular level, the pathological characteristics include the extracellular aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) forming senile plaques, and the intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins forming neurofibrillary tangles. AD leads to the progressive decline of cognitive, behavioral, and social abilities, with no effective treatment available currently. The pathophysiology of AD is complex, involving mechanisms such as immune dysregulation and lipid metabolism alterations. Immune cells, such as microglia, can identify and clear pathological aggregates like Aβ early in the disease. However, prolonged or excessive activation of immune cells may trigger chronic neuroinflammation, thereby accelerating neuronal damage and the progression of AD. Lipid metabolism plays a critical role in maintaining cell membrane structure and function, regulating the production and clearance of Aβ, and supplying energy to the brain. Disruptions in these processes are closely linked to the pathological progression of AD. The interaction between lipid metabolism and the immune system further exacerbates the disease progression of AD. In this review, we discuss the lipid metabolism and immune response in AD, summarize their intricate interactions, and highlight the complexity of the multifactorial pathogenic cascade, offering insights into new interventions targeting the immune-metabolic axis in AD.

## 251. Association Between Oral Microbiota Dysbiosis and the Risk of Dementia: A Systematic Review. Buyang Huanwu Decoction Modulates the Gut Microbiota-C/EBPβ/AEP Axis to Ameliorate Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease Mice.

Background/Objectives: Growing evidence suggests that oral microbiota dysbiosis may contribute to the development of systemic conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. This dysregulation promotes immunoinflammatory responses that are increasingly associated with dementia. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association between oral microbiota dysbiosis and the risk of dementia in older adults. Methods: Eligible studies evaluated oral microbial composition using validated methods such as genetic sequencing, bacterial culture, or metagenomic analysis. Following PRISMA guidelines and a PICO framework, the review included cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. Searches were conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Two independent reviewers screened and selected studies, resolving disagreements through a third evaluator. Results: This systematic review revealed that Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, Fusobacteriota, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Candida spp. were consistently associated with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, indicating their potential role in neurodegeneration. In contrast, Streptococcus gordonii, Gemella haemolysans, Rothia, Neisseria, and Haemophilus were reduced in cognitively impaired individuals, suggesting a link with healthy cognition. Studies also showed decreased microbial diversity in Alzheimer's disease and the possible modifying effect of the APOE4 allele. Oral health interventions improved microbial composition and slowed cognitive decline, supporting the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of oral microbiota modulation. Conclusions: The findings suggest that oral microbiota dysbiosis may not only result from cognitive decline but also contribute to its pathogenesis. Future studies with larger and more diverse cohorts are recommended to validate these associations. BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances. Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese herbal formulation, has demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic impact of BYHWD on cognitive impairments in 3×Tg mice and to investigate its underlying mechanism through modulation of the gut microbiota-C/EBPβ/AEP signaling pathway. METHODS: In two independent experiments, we assessed the effects of BYHWD and its derived fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT-BYHWD) on behavioral performance, neuropathological alterations, and signaling pathways in 3×Tg mice. RESULTS: Treatment with BYHWD significantly improved cognitive function in 3×Tg mice and mitigated AD-like pathological changes. By suppressing the C/EBPβ/AEP signaling pathway, BYHWD reduced pathological Aβ plaque deposition, diminished tau hyperphosphorylation, and inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further analysis revealed that BYHWD restored gut microbiota balance and suppressed the activation of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in the hippocampus. Moreover, transplanting FMT-BYHWD from BYHWD-treated mice to germ-free 3×Tg mice also ameliorated their cognitive deficits and AD-like pathology, suggesting that the anti-AD effects of BYHWD are mediated through the gut-brain axis by regulating the interplay between gut microbiota and the C/EBPβ/AEP signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study uncovers the mechanism by which BYHWD improves cognitive deficits and neuropathological changes in 3×Tg mice via the gut-brain axis, mediated by the modulation of the gut microbiota-C/EBPβ/AEP signaling pathway, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

## 252. Gastrointestinal inflammation and cancer: viral and bacterial interplay.

Gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and malignancies arise from complex interactions between the host's immune responses and microbial pathogens. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contribute to chronic GI inflammation, immune evasion, and tumorigenesis through distinct but interconnected mechanisms. EBV, a widespread herpesvirus, establishes a latent infection in B cells and epithelial cells. It promotes gastric carcinogenesis through immune modulation, epigenetic changes, and viral microRNAs (miRNAs). H. pylori, a gastric carcinogen, induces chronic gastritis and gastric cancer (GC) through Cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and Vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (VacA) virulence factors. These factors disrupt host immune responses and enhance oncogenic signaling pathways. Recent evidence also links SARS-CoV-2 to gut dysbiosis and inflammatory responses. It worsens immune dysfunction and hence potentially impacting GI pathology. EBV and H. pylori co-infections may synergistically amplify inflammatory signaling, creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. This review emphasizes the molecular mechanisms by which these pathogens contribute to GI diseases, focusing on their immune evasion strategies and potential therapeutic targets. Understanding these interactions is essential for developing targeted interventions for infection-driven GI malignancies.

## 253. Polygoni Multiflori Radix Praeparata polysaccharides enhance gut health and mitigate ischemic stroke by regulating SCFA and amino acid metabolism in gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common type of stroke, known for its high rates of morbidity, disability, mortality, and recurrence. Polygoni Multiflori Radix Praeparata (PM), a traditional Chinese medicinal tonic, is frequently used for treating IS. Its polysaccharides (PMP) are acknowledged for their hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. However, the effectiveness and mechanisms of PMP remain inadequately understood. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of PMP on IS and clarify the potential mechanisms involved. METHODS: PMP was obtained by water extraction, alcohol precipitation, Sevage deproteinization, and dialysis. Its molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, and FT-IR spectrum were characterized. IS was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in male SD rats. Neurological assessment, histopathology, and protein factors detection assessed PMP's effectiveness. Further, (1)H NMR based metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing examined gut microbiota metabolites and profiles, respectively, in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of the gut-brain axis. RESULTS: PMP significantly improved the neurologic functions and reduced the cerebral infarction volume in MCAO/R rats. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injured brain and also affected intestine, leading to gut barrier disruption. PMP could lower the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, and boost tight junction protein both in brain and intestinal tissues. Metabolomic analysis shows PMP raised intestinal levels of SCFAs (butyrate, propionate) and beneficial amino acids, thus improving disrupted carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Muribaculaceae, and Lactobacillus was reversed after PMP intervention. The family Bacteroidaceae and the genus Bacteroides correlated positively with amino acids, and might contributed to the SCFAs production. While the family Peptostreptococcaceae and the genus Romboutsia correlated negatively with SCFAs, might related to the poor prognosis of IS. CONCLUSION: PMP markedly enhanced SCFAs and amino acid metabolism, as well as the proliferation of beneficial gut microbiota, thereby promoting intestinal health and barrier integrity, and thus relieving MCAO/R induced I/R injury both in brain and intestine. Our study substantiates the potential of PMP as a prebiotic health supplement in clinical settings for the prevention and treatment of IS.

## 254. Targeting microglia polarization with Chinese herb-derived natural compounds for neuroprotection in ischemic stroke.

Given that ischemic stroke ranks as one of the most fatal diseases globally, it is imperative to develop clinically effective neuroprotective agents for stroke. Microglia serve as innate immune cells for maintaining brain homeostasis, and upon activation, they are well-known to be able to transform into two functional phenotypes, namely, the M1 and M2 types, which can convert each other and exert opposing effects on neurotoxicity and neuroprotection, respectively. Traditional Chinese medicine possesses a deep-rooted and profound history with rich theory in treating cerebrovascular disorders, and its natural compounds have been considered as promising adjunctive therapies. Recently, researchers have been devoting attention to the inflammation-suppressive properties of the compounds from Chinese herbs. These compounds are gradually emerging as adoptable therapeutic agents with wide application prospect for improving stroke outcomes, through regulating microglial polarization to attenuate neuroinflammation. Thereby, we reviewed the functions of microglial cells in inflammation and neuroprotection and explored the regulation of microglial activity by natural compounds to alleviate neuroinflammation and protect neural function after ischemic stroke. Collectively, using natural compounds to suppress the microglia-mediated detrimental inflammatory response, meanwhile enhancing their anti-inflammatory abilities to accelerate neuronal recovery, will be promising therapeutic approaches for ischemic stroke.

## 255. ⁠⁠Functional Foods Alleviate Behavioral Alterations and Improve GABAergic System Regulating TLR-4/NF-κB Axis in Valproic-Induced Autism.

SCOPE: Valproic acid (VPA) postnatal exposure in mice results in behavioral impairment, aberrant sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and self-harming behavior, hallmarks of autism. According to previous reports, Coriolus versicolor (CV) has a protective effect on the brain. The goal of the current investigation was to assess how CV affected the neurobehavioral and metabolic changes caused by VPA in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice pups were injected with VPA at 14 days of age and orally administered CV at a dose of 200 mg/kg daily from 14 to 40 days of age. Mice pups were placed through behavioral tests during the trial to evaluate motor skill growth, nociceptive response, locomotion, anxiety, and cognition. Following behavioral testing, mice were killed, and the brain was removed and subjected to biochemical analyses (glutathione, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide) and histopathological analysis. Additionally, to further investigate the role of the TLR-4/Myd88/NF-κB signaling pathway, we examined the modulation of this pathway and the alteration in gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) production using Western blot analysis. CONCLUSION: According to our research, CV daily administration greatly reduced behavioral alteration, reversed the disorganization of the cerebellum and hippocampus, and significantly improved the VPA-induced neuroinflammation via the TLR-4/Myd88/NF-κB signaling cascade.

## 256. The Interplay of Cross-Organ Immune Regulation in Inflammation and Cancer.

Organs dynamically interact with each other through immunomodulation to create a systemic immune response and influence disease progression. While traditional studies have tended to focus on single-organ immunity, recent studies have placed greater emphasis on reciprocal immune interactions between organs, such as those between the gut, liver, and brain. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these interorgan immune interactions remain unclear. Here, we synthesize the molecular and cellular bases of cross-organ immune regulation in the context of inflammation and neoplasia. Specifically, we describe the immune coordination between the gut, liver, and brain and how they immunomodulate other organs (including the thyroid, lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, bone, and skin). In addition, we explore clinical therapies that target these cross-organ immune modulations, the limitations of the treatments, and the potential benefits for patients. We also conclude by highlighting innovative technologies such as multiomics analysis, machine learning, and organ-on-a-chip platforms, which are providing unprecedented insights into interorgan immunity. Elucidating these mechanisms will advance precision medicine and enable the development of targeted therapies for diseases caused by cross-organ immunity.

## 257. Effects of Dendrobium officinale Kimura & Migo flower flavonoids on cognitive function by regulating gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: As we get older, we experience a variety of symptoms such as memory and cognitive decline in learning. In the process of aging, neuroinflammatory response is one of the main reasons for the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction. Dendrobium officinale Kimura & Migo flower flavonoids (DOFF) can effectively regulate the structure of intestinal microbiota, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions. METHODS: DOFF samples were extracted by water extraction assisted ultrasonic ethanol method. The DOFF composition was determined by LC-MS/MS method. An aging mouse model was established using D-galactose (D-gal) induced mice. 16S rDNA sequencing was used to analyze intestinal flora, hematoxylin/eosin staining (H&E) and immunohistochemical staining were used to analyze colonic and hippocampal tissue damage and related proteins, and ElISA was used to determine related inflammatory factors. The Y-maze experiment was used to test the cognitive ability of mice, the expression of related synaptic protein was detected by WB, and Iba-1 was labeled by immunofluorescence to study the effects of DOFF on inflammatory response and cognitive function by regulating intestinal microbiota. RESULTS: The results showed that DOFF intervention could regulate the relative abundance of intestinal flora in D-gal mice, including the relative abundance of Akkermansia, down-regulate the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, up-regulate the expression of ZO-1, and improve the colonic tissue injury. In addition, by inhibiting the production of MDA, increasing the activity of SOD, CAT and POD, inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, inhibiting the activation of microglia, and effectively improving the oxidative stress damage and inflammation caused by aging. By increasing the expression of related synaptic proteins, upregulation of BDNF levels improves synaptic plasticity and alleviates cognitive dysfunction. DISCUSSION: DOFF can improve cognitive dysfunction by regulating intestinal microbiota composition, enhancing intestinal barrier integrity in D-GAL-induced aging mice, improving neuroinflammation, and alleviating hippocampal neuron damage.

## 258. Phytotherapy and the Role of Bioactive Compounds in Modulating Mechanisms of Overweight and Obesity Comorbid with Depressive Symptoms-A Scoping Review of Mechanisms of Action.

Obesity and depression frequently coexist, sharing overlapping molecular pathways such as inflammation, oxidative stress, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and neuroendocrine dysfunction. Recent research highlights the therapeutic potential of plant-derived bioactive compounds in targeting these shared mechanisms. This scoping review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included 261 peer-reviewed studies identified through PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science up to December 2024. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review synthesizes data from peer-reviewed studies, including both preclinical and clinical investigations, focusing on polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and other phytochemicals with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and metabolic effects. Compounds such as quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, curcumin, anthocyanins, and luteolin demonstrate promise in modulating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and gut-brain axis pathways. Our scoping review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, identifies promising combinations and mechanisms for integrative phytotherapy. These findings underscore the potential of botanical strategies in developing future interventions for metabolic and mood comorbidities.

## 259. Sodium oligomannate alters gut microbiota, reduces cerebral amyloidosis and reactive microglia in a sex-specific manner.

It has recently become well-established that there is a connection between Alzheimer's disease pathology and gut microbiome dysbiosis. We have previously demonstrated that antibiotic-mediated gut microbiota perturbations lead to attenuation of Aβ deposition, phosphorylated tau accumulation, and disease-associated glial cell phenotypes in a sex-dependent manner. In this regard, we were intrigued by the finding that a marine-derived oligosaccharide, GV-971, was reported to alter gut microbiota and reduce Aβ amyloidosis in the 5XFAD mouse model that were treated at a point when Aβ burden was near plateau levels. Utilizing comparable methodologies, but with distinct technical and temporal features, we now report on the impact of GV-971 on gut microbiota, Aβ amyloidosis and microglial phenotypes in the APPPS1-21 model, studies performed at the University of Chicago, and independently in the 5X FAD model, studies performed at Washington University, St. Louis.Methods To comprehensively characterize the effects of GV-971 on the microbiota-microglia-amyloid axis, we conducted two separate investigations at independent institutions. There was no coordination of the experimental design or execution between the two laboratories. Indeed, the two laboratories were not aware of each other's experiments until the studies were completed. Male and female APPPS1-21 mice were treated daily with 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg of GV-971 from 8, when Aβ burden was detectable upto 12 weeks of age when Aβ burden was near maximal levels. In parallel, and to corroborate existing published studies and further investigate sex-related differences, male and female 5XFAD mice were treated daily with 100 mg/kg of GV-971 from 7 to 9 months of age when Aβ burden was near peak levels. Subsequently, the two laboratories independently assessed amyloid-β deposition, metagenomic, and neuroinflammatory profiles. Finally, studies were initiated at the University of Chicago to evaluate the metabolites in cecal tissue from vehicle and GV-971-treated 5XFAD mice.Results These studies showed that independent of the procedural differences (dosage, timing and duration of treatment) between the two laboratories, cerebral amyloidosis was reduced primarily in male mice, independent of strain. We also observed sex-specific microbiota differences following GV-971 treatment. Interestingly, GV-971 significantly altered multiple overlapping bacterial species at both institutions. Moreover, we discovered that GV-971 significantly impacted microbiome metabolism, particularly by elevating amino acid production and influencing the tryptophan pathway. The metagenomics and metabolomics changes correspond with notable reductions in peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profiles. Furthermore, GV-971 treatment dampened astrocyte and microglia activation, significantly decreasing plaque-associated reactive microglia while concurrently increasing homeostatic microglia only in male mice. Bulk RNAseq analysis unveiled sex-specific changes in cerebral cortex transcriptome profiles, but most importantly, the transcriptome changes in the GV-971-treated male group revealed the involvement of microglia and inflammatory responses.Conclusions In conclusion, these studies demonstrate the connection between the gut microbiome, neuroinflammation, and Alzheimer's disease pathology while highlighting the potential therapeutic effect of GV-971. GV-971 targets the microbiota-microglia-amyloid axis, leading to the lowering of plaque pathology and neuroinflammatory signatures in a sex-dependent manner when given at the onset of Aβ deposition or when given after Aβ deposition is already at higher levels.

## 260. Rubusoside mitigates neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis in Parkinson's disease, and alters gut microbiota and metabolite composition.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PD, involving the activation of microglia cells, heightened production of proinflammatory cytokines, and perturbations in the composition of the gut microbiota. Rubusoside (Ru), the principal steviol bisglucoside present in Rubus chingii var. suavissimus (S.K.Lee) L.T.Lu (Rosaceae), has been documented for its anti-inflammatory properties in diverse disease models. Nonetheless, there is an imperative need to comprehensively assess and elucidate the protective and anti-inflammatory attributes of Ru concerning PD, as well as to uncover the underlying mechanism involved.

## 261. Oxytocin Intervention Mitigates Pathological and Behavioral Impairments in APP/PS1 Mice Subjected to Early Social Isolation.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, are prevalent during the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Social isolation (SI) has been implicated as a potential exacerbating factor for emotional disturbances in AD pathogenesis. Despite the well-established role of oxytocin (OXT) in regulating social behavior and mental health, its function and mechanisms in alleviating AD-related psychiatric symptoms remain poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized a 12-week SI model to assess its effects on anxiety, depression-like behaviors, and social cognition in early-stage AD mice. Through immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 16S rDNA sequencing, we examined the changes in AD pathology and gut microbiota composition induced by SI, as well as the effects of OXT intervention. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that SI markedly intensified anxiety-like behaviors, depression-like phenotypes, and social cognitive impairments in AD mice. Mechanistically, SI resulted in decreased OXT levels and upregulated OXT receptor expression while also exacerbating AD-related pathological features, including increased Aβ plaque deposition, aberrant microglial proliferation, and reduced PSD-95 expression in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, SI induced significant changes in gut microbiota composition. OXT intervention demonstrated therapeutic efficacy by mitigating behavioral deficits, alleviating AD-related pathological damage, and restoring gut microbiota homeostasis in SI AD mice. CONCLUSION: These results underscore OXT as a promising therapeutic avenue for AD, offering novel insights into treatment strategies and identifying potential therapeutic targets through the restoration of gut homeostasis and mitigation of pathological processes.

## 262. The biological activity and potential of probiotics-derived extracellular vesicles as postbiotics in modulating microbiota-host communication.

Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. have been shown to be critical for maintaining host homeostasis. In recent years, key compounds of postbiotics derived from probiotic metabolism and cellular secretion have been identified for their role in maintaining organ immunity and regulating intestinal inflammation. In particular, probiotic-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) can act as postbiotics, maintaining almost the same functional activity as probiotics. They also have strong biocompatibility and loading capacity to carry exogenous or parental active molecules to reach distal organs to play their roles. This provides a new direction for understanding the intrinsic microbiota-host communication mechanism. However, most current studies on PEVs are limited to their functional effects/benefits, and their specific physicochemical properties, composition, intrinsic mechanisms for maintaining host homeostasis, and possible threats remain to be explored. Here, we review and summarize the unique physicochemical properties of PEVs and their bioactivities and mechanisms in mediating microbiota-host communication, and elucidate the limitations of the current research on PEVs and their potential application as postbiotics.

## 263. Gut-brain axis and neurodegeneration: mechanisms and therapeutic potentials.

This paper reviews the effects of gut microbiota in regulating neurodegenerative diseases through controlling gut-brain axis. Specific microbial populations and their metabolites (short-chain fatty acids and tryptophan derivatives) regulate neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and neural barrier integrity. We then discuss ways by which these insights lead to possible interventions - probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modification, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). We also describe what epidemiological and clinical studies have related certain microbiota profiles with the courses of neurodegenerative diseases and how these impact the establishment of microbiome-based diagnostics and individualized treatment options. We aim to guide microbial ecology research on this key link to neurodegenerative disorders and also to highlight collaborative approaches to manage neurological health by targeting microbiome-related factors.

## 264. Exploring the effect of gut microbiome on Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread and irreversible form of dementia and accounts for more than half of dementia cases. The most significant risk factors for AD are aging-related exacerbations, degradation of anatomical pathways, environmental variables and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finding a decisive therapeutic solution is a major current issue. Nuanced interactions between major neuropathological mechanisms in AD in patients and microbiome have recently gained rising attention. The presence of bacterial amyloid in the gut triggers the immune system, resulting in increased immune feedbacks and endogenous neuronal amyloid within the CNS. Also, early clinical research revealed that changing the microbiome with beneficial bacteria or probiotics could affect brain function in AD. New approaches focus on the possible neuroprotective action of disease-modifying medications in AD. In the present review, we discuss the impact of the gut microbiota on the brain and review emerging research that suggests a disruption in the microbiota-brain axis can affect AD by mediating neuroinflammation. Such novel methods could help the development of novel therapeutics for AD.

## 265. Microbiome-based therapeutics for Parkinson's disease.

Recent experimental and clinical data demonstrate a significant dysregulation of the gut microbiome in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). With an immense influence on all aspects of physiology, this dysregulation has potential to directly or indirectly contribute to disease pathology. Experimental models have bridged these associations toward defined contributions, identifying various microbiome-dependent impacts to PD pathology. These studies have laid the foundation for human translation, examining whether certain members of the microbiome and/or whole restoration of the gut microbiome community can provide therapeutic benefit for people living with PD. Here, we review recent and ongoing clinically-focused studies that use microbiome-targeted therapies to limit the severity and progression of PD. Fecal microbiome transplants, prebiotic interventions, and probiotic supplementation are each emerging as viable methodologies to augment the gut microbiome and potentially limit PD symptoms. While still early, the data in the field to date support continued cross-talk between experimental systems and human studies to identify key microbial factors that contribute to PD pathologies.

## 266. Microbiome and Metabolome Insights into the Role of the Gastrointestinal-Brain Axis in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease: Unveiling Potential Therapeutic Targets.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the prevalence of which is rapidly rising due to an aging world population and westernization of lifestyles, are expected to put a strong socioeconomic burden on health systems worldwide. Clinical trials of therapies against PD and AD have only shown limited success so far. Therefore, research has extended its scope to a systems medicine point of view, with a particular focus on the gastrointestinal-brain axis as a potential main actor in disease development and progression. Microbiome and metabolome studies have already revealed important insights into disease mechanisms. Both the microbiome and metabolome can be easily manipulated by dietary and lifestyle interventions, and might thus offer novel, readily available therapeutic options to prevent the onset as well as the progression of PD and AD. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the interplay between microbiota, metabolites, and neurodegeneration along the gastrointestinal-brain axis. We further illustrate state-of-the art methods of microbiome and metabolome research as well as metabolic modeling that facilitate the identification of disease pathomechanisms. We conclude with therapeutic options to modulate microbiome composition to prevent or delay neurodegeneration and illustrate potential future research directions to fight PD and AD.

## 267. Modulation of Gut Microbiota Through Dietary Intervention in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. One of the main modulators of the gut microbiota is the diet, which directly influences host homeostasis and biological processes. Some dietary patterns can affect neurodegenerative diseases' progression through gut microbiota composition, gut permeability, and the synthesis and secretion of microbial-derived neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters. This comprehensive review critically assesses existing studies investigating the impact of dietary interventions on the modulation of the microbiota in relation to neurodegenerative diseases and neuroinflammation.

## 268. The Role of Microbial Metabolites in the Progression of Neurodegenerative Diseases-Therapeutic Approaches: A Comprehensive Review.

The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive examination of the role of microbial metabolites in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to investigate potential therapeutic interventions targeting the microbiota. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Wiley. Key terms related to the gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, neurodegenerative diseases, and specific metabolic products were used. The review included both preclinical and clinical research articles published between 2000 and 2024. Short-chain fatty acids have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in modulating neuroinflammation, preserving the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and influencing neuronal plasticity and protection. Furthermore, amino acids and their derivatives have been demonstrated to exert a significant influence on CNS function. These microbial metabolites impact CNS health by regulating intestinal permeability, modulating immune responses, and directly influencing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which are integral to neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic strategies, including prebiotics, probiotics, dietary modifications, and fecal microbiota transplantation have confirmed the potential to restore microbial balance and enhance the production of neuroprotective metabolites. Furthermore, novel drug developments based on microbial metabolites present promising therapeutic avenues. The gut microbiota and its metabolites represent a promising field of research with the potential to advance our understanding of and develop treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

## 269. The Role of Gastrointestinal Dysbiosis and Fecal Transplantation in Various Neurocognitive Disorders.

This review explores the critical role of the human microbiome in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on gut-brain axis dysfunction caused by dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut bacteria. Dysbiosis has been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke. The gut microbiome influences the central nervous system (CNS) through signaling molecules, including short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters, and metabolites, impacting brain health and disease progression. Emerging therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have shown promise in restoring microbial balance and alleviating neurological symptoms, especially in Alzheimer's and PD. Additionally, nutritional interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and specialized diets are being investigated for their ability to modify gut microbiota and improve patient outcomes. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of gut microbiota modulation but emphasizes the need for further clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of these interventions in neurological and mental health disorders.

## 270. A Review of the Consequences of Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Aging.

Age-associated alterations in the brain lead to cognitive deterioration and neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). This review with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD), emphasizes the burgeoning significance of the gut microbiota (GMB) in neuroinflammation and its impact on the gut-brain axis (GBA), a communication conduit between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS). Changes in the gut microbiome, including diminished microbial diversity and the prevalence of pro-inflammatory bacteria, are associated with AD pathogenesis. Promising therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, and prebiotics, may restore gut health and enhance cognitive performance. Clinical data remain insufficient, necessitating further research to elucidate causes, enhance therapy, and consider individual variances. This integrative approach may yield innovative therapies aimed at the GMB to improve cognitive function and brain health in older people.

## 271. Gut microbiota defined epigenomes of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases reveal novel targets for therapy.

The origins of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) involve genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, neurotoxin exposure and gut microbiota dysregulation. The gut microbiota's dynamic composition and its metabolites influence intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity, contributing to AD and PD development. This review explores protein misfolding, aggregation and epigenetic links in AD and PD pathogenesis. It also highlights the role of a leaky gut and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in promoting these diseases through inflammation-induced epigenetic alterations. In addition, we investigate the potential of diet, probiotics and microbiota transplantation for preventing and treating AD and PD via epigenetic modifications, along with a discussion related to current challenges and future considerations. These approaches offer promise for translating research findings into practical clinical applications.

## 272. Mechanistic Insights Into Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis-Mediated Neuroimmune Dysregulation and Protein Misfolding and Clearance in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Neurodegenerative Disorders.

The human gut microbiota is a complex, dynamic, and highly diverse community of microorganisms. Beginning as early as <i>in utero</i> fetal development and continuing through birth to late-stage adulthood, the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and brain is essential for modulating various metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and immune-related pathways. Conversely, microbial dysbiosis - defined as alterations in richness and relative abundances - of the gut is implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence from large-population cohort studies suggests that individuals with neurodegenerative conditions have an altered gut microbial composition as well as microbial and serum metabolomic profiles distinct from those in the healthy population. Dysbiosis is also linked to psychiatric and gastrointestinal complications - comorbidities often associated with the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have identified potential mediators that link gut dysbiosis and neurological disorders. Recent findings have also elucidated the potential mechanisms of disease pathology in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. This review highlights the functional pathways and mechanisms, particularly gut microbe-induced chronic inflammation, protein misfolding, propagation of disease-specific pathology, defective protein clearance, and autoimmune dysregulation, linking gut microbial dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. In addition, we also discuss how pathogenic transformation of microbial composition leads to increased endotoxin production and fewer beneficial metabolites, both of which could trigger immune cell activation and enteric neuronal dysfunction. These can further disrupt intestinal barrier permeability, aggravate the systemic pro-inflammatory state, impair blood-brain barrier permeability and recruit immune mediators leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Continued biomedical advances in understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis will extend the frontier of neurodegenerative disorders and enable the utilization of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to mitigate the pathological burden of these diseases.

## 273. Psychobiotic Properties of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum in Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Neurodegenerative disorders are the main cause of cognitive and physical disabilities, affect millions of people worldwide, and their incidence is on the rise. Emerging evidence pinpoints a disturbance of the communication of the gut-brain axis, and in particular to gut microbial dysbiosis, as one of the contributors to the pathogenesis of these diseases. In fact, dysbiosis has been associated with neuro-inflammatory processes, hyperactivation of the neuronal immune system, impaired cognitive functions, aging, depression, sleeping disorders, and anxiety. With the rapid advance in metagenomics, metabolomics, and big data analysis, together with a multidisciplinary approach, a new horizon has just emerged in the fields of translational neurodegenerative disease. In fact, recent studies focusing on taxonomic profiling and leaky gut in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders are not only shedding light on an overlooked field but are also creating opportunities for biomarker discovery and development of new therapeutic and adjuvant strategies to treat these disorders. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LBP) strains are emerging as promising psychobiotics for the treatment of these diseases. In fact, LBP strains are able to promote eubiosis, increase the enrichment of bacteria producing beneficial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, boost the production of neurotransmitters, and support the homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with a particular focus on the benefits of LBP strains in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism, anxiety, and depression.

## 274. Do the Bugs in Your Gut Eat Your Memories? Relationship between Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease.

The human microbiota is composed of trillions of microbial cells inhabiting the oral cavity, skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, airways, and reproductive organs. The gut microbiota is composed of dynamic communities of microorganisms that communicate bidirectionally with the brain via cytokines, neurotransmitters, hormones, and secondary metabolites, known as the gut microbiota-brain axis. The gut microbiota-brain axis is suspected to be involved in the development of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. AD is an irreversible, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. Microglia and astrocytes, the resident immune cells of the CNS, play an integral role in AD development, as neuroinflammation is a driving factor of disease severity. The gut microbiota-brain axis is a novel target for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics to modulate critical neuroimmune and metabolic pathways. Potential therapeutics include probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary intervention. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of the gut microbiota-brain axis and neuroinflammation in the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease, limitations of current research, and potential for gut microbiota-brain axis targeted therapies.

## 275. Gut Microbiota and Immune System Dynamics in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases.

The gut microbiota, a diverse collection of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a critical role in regulating metabolic, immune, and cognitive functions. Disruptions in the composition of these microbial communities, termed dysbiosis, have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the key pathological features of NDs is neuroinflammation, which involves the activation of microglia and peripheral immune cells. The gut microbiota modulates immune responses through the production of metabolites and interactions with immune cells, influencing the inflammatory processes within the central nervous system. This review explores the impact of gut dysbiosis on neuroinflammation, focusing on the roles of microglia, immune cells, and potential therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota to alleviate neuroinflammatory processes in NDs.

## 276. Gut microbiota metabolites: potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease?

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function, which significantly increases pain and social burden. However, few therapeutic interventions are effective in preventing or mitigating the progression of AD. An increasing number of recent studies support the hypothesis that the gut microbiome and its metabolites may be associated with upstream regulators of AD pathology. METHODS: In this review, we comprehensively explore the potential mechanisms and currently available interventions targeting the microbiome for the improvement of AD. Our discussion is structured around modern research advancements in AD, the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, the multi-target regulatory effects of microbial metabolites on AD, and therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating gut microbiota to manage AD. RESULTS: The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD through continuous bidirectional communication via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Among these, microbial metabolites such as lipids, amino acids, bile acids and neurotransmitters, especially sphingolipids and phospholipids, may serve as central components of the gut-brain axis, regulating AD-related pathogenic mechanisms including β-amyloid metabolism, Tau protein phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Additionally, interventions such as probiotic administration, fecal microbiota transplantation, and antibiotic use have also provided evidence supporting the association between gut microbiota and AD. At the same time, we propose an innovative strategy for treating AD: a healthy lifestyle combined with targeted probiotics and other potential therapeutic interventions, aiming to restore intestinal ecology and microbiota balance. CONCLUSION: Despite previous efforts, the molecular mechanisms by which gut microbes act on AD have yet to be fully described. However, intestinal microorganisms may become an essential target for connecting the gut-brain axis and improving the symptoms of AD. At the same time, it requires joint exploration by multiple centers and multiple disciplines.

## 277. Reverse engineering the Gut-Brain Axis and microbiome-metabolomics for symbiotic/pathogenic balance in neurodegenerative diseases.

Deciphering the molecular communications along the gut-brain axis can help in understanding the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and exploiting the gut microbiome for therapeutics. However, gut microbes and their metabolites have a multifaceted role in mediating both brain physiology and neurodegenerative pathology. There is a lack of understanding of how and when this role is tipped in neurodegenerative diseases and what are those contributing factors, both at local (gut) and distal (neuronal) levels, that drive this imbalance. Here we have reviewed the gut microbiome and its metabolites in the context of the gut-brain axis and summarized how different factors such as gut-microbial diversity, their metabolites, the role of the native immune system and the integrity of gut epithelial and blood-brain barriers are interconnected and collectively define the involvement of gut-microbiome in neurodegenerative pathologies. It also underlines the need for multidisciplinary tools and animal models to simultaneously reflect on many of these factors and to better correlate with clinical observations and data obtained from human biopsies and fecal samples. Harnessing the gut-brain axis will herald a paradigm shift in medicine for neurodegenerative diseases and aging, emphasizing the significance of the microbiome in the broader spectrum of health and disease.

## 278. Gut-brain axis: A cutting-edge approach to target neurological disorders and potential synbiotic application.

The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a sophisticated communication network between the brain and the gut, involving immunological, endocrinological, and neural mediators. This bidirectional interaction is facilitated through the vagus nerve, sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, and is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Evidence shows that alterations in gut microbiota composition, or dysbiosis, significantly impact neurological disorders (NDs) like anxiety, depression, autism, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dysbiosis can affect the central nervous system (CNS) via neuroinflammation and microglial activation, highlighting the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in disease pathogenesis. The microbiota influences the immune system by modulating chemokines and cytokines, impacting neuronal health. Synbiotics have shown promise in treating NDs by enhancing cognitive function and reducing inflammation. The gut microbiota's role in producing neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is critical for CNS homeostasis. Therapeutic interventions targeting the MGBA, including dietary modulation and synbiotic supplementation, offer potential benefits for managing neurodegenerative disorders. However, more in-depth clinical studies are necessary to fully understand and harness the therapeutic potential of the MGBA in neurological health and disease.

## 279. Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO) as a Rising-Star Metabolite: Implications for Human Health. Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases.

The intestinal microbiota, hosting trillions of microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, functions as a symbiotic organism that plays a crucial role in regulating health by producing biologically active molecules that can enter systemic circulation. Among them, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), an organic compound derived from dietary sources and microbial metabolism, has emerged as a critical biomarker linking diet, the gut microbiota, and the host metabolism to various pathological conditions. This comprehensive review highlights TMAO's biosynthesis, physiological functions, and clinical significance, focusing on its mechanistic contributions to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, TMAO-mediated pathways include endothelial dysfunction, inflammation via NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and cholesterol metabolism disruption, which collectively accelerate atherosclerosis and disease progression. Nonetheless, this work underscores the innovative potential of targeting TMAO through dietary, nutraceutical, and microbiota-modulating strategies to mitigate its pathological effects, marking a transformative approach in the prevention and management of TMAO-related disorders. BACKGROUND: Age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) pose a formidable challenge to healthcare systems worldwide due to their complex pathogenesis, significant morbidity, and mortality. Scope and Approach: This comprehensive review aims to elucidate the central role of the microbiotagut- brain axis (MGBA) in ND pathogenesis. Specifically, it delves into the perturbations within the gut microbiota and its metabolomic landscape, as well as the structural and functional transformations of the gastrointestinal and blood-brain barrier interfaces in ND patients. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in medicinal and dietary interventions tailored to modulate the MGBA for ND therapy. CONCLUSION: Accumulating evidence underscores the pivotal role of the gut microbiota in ND pathogenesis through the MGBA. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and associated metabolites instigate structural modifications and augmented permeability of both the gastrointestinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These alterations facilitate the transit of microbial molecules from the gut to the brain via neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, potentially contributing to the etiology of NDs. Numerous investigational strategies, encompassing prebiotic and probiotic interventions, pharmaceutical trials, and dietary adaptations, are actively explored to harness the microbiota for ND treatment. This work endeavors to enhance our comprehension of the intricate mechanisms underpinning ND pathogenesis, offering valuable insights for the development of innovative therapeutic modalities targeting these debilitating disorders.

## 280. The role of the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases targeting metabolism.

In recent years, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) has gradually increased over the past decades due to the rapid aging of the global population. Traditional research has had difficulty explaining the relationship between its etiology and unhealthy lifestyle and diets. Emerging evidence had proved that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases may be related to changes of the gut microbiota's composition. Metabolism of gut microbiota has insidious and far-reaching effects on neurodegenerative diseases and provides new directions for disease intervention. Here, we delineated the basic relationship between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the metabolism of gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases and also focusing on treatments for NDs based on gut microbiota. Our review may provide novel insights for neurodegeneration and approach a broadly applicable basis for the clinical therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.

## 281. Gut microbiota therapy in gastrointestinal diseases.

The human gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal (GI) health and disease. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in microbial composition, has been linked to a range of GI disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease, and colorectal cancer. These conditions are influenced by the interactions between the gut microbiota, the host immune system, and the gut-brain axis. Recent research has highlighted the potential for microbiome-based therapeutic strategies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and dietary modifications, to restore microbial balance and alleviate disease symptoms. This review examines the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of common gastrointestinal diseases and explores emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the microbiome. We discuss the scientific foundations of these interventions, their clinical effectiveness, and the challenges in their implementation. The review underscores the therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted treatments as a novel approach to managing GI disorders, offering personalized and alternative options to conventional therapies. As research in this field continues to evolve, microbiome-based interventions hold promise for improving the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases.

## 282. The brain-gut axis: communication mechanisms and the role of the microbiome as a neuroprotective factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases: A literature overview.

The study of the brain-gut axis and its impact on cognitive function and in the development of neurodegenerative diseases is a very timely topic of interest to researchers. This review summarizes information on the basic mechanisms of gut-brain communication. We then discuss the roles of the gut microbiome as a neuroprotective factor in neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota is extremely important in maintaining the body's homeostasis, shaping the human immune system and the proper functioning of the brain. The intestinal microflora affects the processes of neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and neuronal regeneration. This review aims to explain changes in the composition of the bacterial population of the intestinal microflora among patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Abnormalities in gut microflora composition are also noted in stress, depression, or autism spectrum development. New observations on psychobiotic supplementation in alleviating the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases are also presented.

## 283. More than just a number: the gut microbiota and brain function across the extremes of life.

Understanding the interrelationship between the gut microbiota and host physiology, although still in its relative infancy, has taken important steps forward over the past decade. In the context of brain disorders including those characterized by neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative changes there have been important advances. However, initially research involved correlational analyses, had limited translational scope, and lacked functional assessments. Thus, largescale longitudinal clinical investigations that assess causation and underlying mechanisms via in depth analysis methods are needed. In neurodegeneration research, strong causal evidence now links the gut microbiome to Alzheimer's (AD), and Parkinson's Disease (PD), as supported by human-to-animal transplantation studies. Longitudinal interventions are being conducted in AD, PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Neurodevelopmental research has also seen a boon in microbiome-related clinical research including in autism, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia, which is confirming prior animal model work regarding the key time-windows in the gut microbiome important for infant cognition. While recent research advances represent important progress, fundamental knowledge gaps and obstacles remain. Knowing how and why the gut microbiome changes at the extremes of life will develop our mechanistic understanding and help build the evidence base as we strive toward counteracting microbial missteps with precision therapeutic interventions.

## 284. Molecular imaging of microbiota-gut-brain axis: searching for the right targeted probe for the right target and disease.

The highly bidirectional dialogue between the gut and the brain is markedly stimulated and influenced by the microbiome through integrated neuroendocrine, neurological and immunological processes. Gut microbiota itself communicate with the host producing hormonal intermediates, metabolites, proteins, and toxins responsible for a variety of biochemical and functional inputs, thereby shaping host homeostasis. Indeed, a dysregulated microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the origin of many neuroimmune-mediated disorders, e.g. autism, multiple sclerosis, depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, which appear months or even years prior to a diagnosis, corroborating the theory that the pathological process is spread from the gut to the brain. A much deeper comprehension of how commensal microbe can be manipulated to interfere with disease progression is crucial for developing new strategies to diagnose and treat diseases. In recent years, the potential of positron-emission-tomography (PET) in the field of bacteria detection has gained attention. The uptake of several PET tracers has been evaluated to investigate infection pathophysiology, e.g. sterile or pathogen-mediated infection, monitoring of progression, or as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. In this minireview, we briefly describe the role of microbiome-gut-brain axis in health and disease and we discuss the imaging modalities and agents that could be applied to study the dynamic interactions between microbiome, gut and brain. These are key aspects in understanding the biochemical lexicon underpinning the microbiome-host crosstalk that would enable the development of diagnostics and therapeutics by targeting the human microbiota.

## 285. The Brain-Gut Axis, an Important Player in Alzheimer and Parkinson Disease: A Narrative Review.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are severe age-related disorders with complex and multifactorial causes. Recent research suggests a critical link between neurodegeneration and the gut microbiome, via the gut-brain communication pathway. This review examines the role of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, in the development of AD and PD, and investigates its interaction with microRNAs (miRNAs) along this bidirectional pathway. TMAO, which is produced from dietary metabolites like choline and carnitine, has been linked to increased neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, and cognitive decline. In AD, elevated TMAO levels are associated with amyloid-beta and tau pathologies, blood-brain barrier disruption, and neuronal death. TMAO can cross the blood-brain barrier and promote the aggregation of amyloid and tau proteins. Similarly, TMAO affects alpha-synuclein conformation and aggregation, a hallmark of PD. TMAO also activates pro-inflammatory pathways such as NF-kB signaling, exacerbating neuroinflammation further. Moreover, TMAO modulates the expression of various miRNAs that are involved in neurodegenerative processes. Thus, the gut microbiome-miRNA-brain axis represents a newly discovered mechanistic link between gut dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. MiRNAs regulate the key pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, contributing to disease progression. As a direct consequence, specific miRNA signatures may serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of AD and PD progression. This review aims to elucidate the complex interrelationships between the gut microbiota, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), microRNAs (miRNAs), and the central nervous system, and the implications of these connections in neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, an overview of the current neuroradiology techniques available for studying neuroinflammation and of the animal models used to investigate these intricate pathologies will also be provided. In summary, a bulk of evidence supports the concept that modulating the gut-brain communication pathway through dietary changes, the manipulation of the microbiome, and/or miRNA-based therapies may offer novel approaches for implementing the treatment of debilitating neurological disorders.

## 286. The Role of Gut Microbiota and Gut-Brain Interplay in Selected Diseases of the Central Nervous System.

The gut microbiome has attracted increasing attention from researchers in recent years. The microbiota can have a specific and complex cross-talk with the host, particularly with the central nervous system (CNS), creating the so-called "gut-brain axis". Communication between the gut, intestinal microbiota, and the brain involves the secretion of various metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), structural components of bacteria, and signaling molecules. Moreover, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition modulates the immune system and function of tissue barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, the aim of this literature review is to describe how the gut-brain interplay may contribute to the development of various neurological disorders, combining the fields of gastroenterology and neuroscience. We present recent findings concerning the effect of the altered microbiota on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the impact of the pathological shift in the microbiome on selected neuropsychological disorders, i.e., major depressive disorders (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is also discussed. Future research on the effect of balanced gut microbiota composition on the gut-brain axis would help to identify new potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions in the presented diseases.

## 287. Brain-Gut and Microbiota-Gut-Brain Communication in Type-2 Diabetes Linked Alzheimer's Disease.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract, home to the largest microbial population in the human body, plays a crucial role in overall health through various mechanisms. Recent advancements in research have revealed the potential implications of gut-brain and vice-versa communication mediated by gut-microbiota and their microbial products in various diseases including type-2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most common type of dementia where most of cases are sporadic with no clearly identiﬁed cause. However, multiple factors are implicated in the progression of sporadic AD which can be classiﬁed as non-modiﬁable (e.g., genetic) and modiﬁable (e.g. Type-2 diabetes, diet etc.). Present review focusses on key players particularly the modiﬁable factors such as Type-2 diabetes (T2D) and diet and their implications in microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) and brain-gut (BG) communication and cognitive functions of healthy brain and their dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease. Special emphasis has been given on elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of the impact of diet on gut-microbiota and the implications of some of the gut-microbial products in T2D and AD pathology. For example, mechanistically, HFD induces gut dysbiosis with driven metabolites that in turn cause loss of integrity of intestinal barrier with concomitant colonic and systemic chronic low-grade inﬂammation, associated with obesity and T2D. HFD-induced obesity and T2D parallel neuroinﬂammation, deposition of Amyloid β (Aβ), and ultimately cognitive impairment. The review also provides a new perspective of the impact of diet on brain-gut and microbiota-gut-brain communication in terms of transcription factors as a commonly spoken language that may facilitates the interaction between gut and brain of obese diabetic patients who are at a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment and AD. Other commonality such as tyrosine kinase expression and functions maintaining intestinal integrity on one hand and the phagocytic clarence by migratory microglial functions in brain are also discussed. Lastly, the characterization of the key players future research that might shed lights on novel potential pharmacological target to impede AD progression are also discussed.

## 288. Gut dysbiosis, defective autophagy and altered immune responses in neurodegenerative diseases: Tales of a vicious cycle.

The human microbiota comprises trillions of symbiotic microorganisms and is involved in regulating gastrointestinal (GI), immune, nervous system and metabolic homeostasis. Recent observations suggest a bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain via immune, circulatory and neural pathways, termed the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA). Alterations in gut microbiota composition, such as seen with an increased number of pathobionts and a decreased number of symbionts, termed gut dysbiosis or microbial intestinal dysbiosis, plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders. Clinical reports confirm that GI symptoms often precede neurological symptoms several years before the development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Pathologically, gut dysbiosis disrupts the integrity of the intestinal barrier leading to ingress of pathobionts and toxic metabolites into the systemic circulation causing GBA dysregulation. Subsequently, chronic neuroinflammation via dysregulated immune activation triggers the accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins in and around CNS cells resulting in neuronal death. Emerging evidence links gut dysbiosis to the aggravation and/or spread of proteinopathies from the peripheral nervous system to the CNS and defective autophagy-mediated proteinopathies. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of gut microbiota in NDDs, and highlights a vicious cycle of gut dysbiosis, immune-mediated chronic neuroinflammation, impaired autophagy and proteinopathies, which contributes to the development of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We also discuss novel therapeutic strategies targeting the modulation of gut dysbiosis through prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics or dietary interventions, and faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) in the management of NDDs.

## 289. The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Neurological Disorders: A Comprehensive Review.

Microbes have inhabited the earth for hundreds of millions of years longer than humans. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a bidirectional communication pathway. These communications occur between the central nervous system (CNS), the enteric nervous system (ENS), and the emotional and cognitive centres of the brain. The field of research on the gut-brain axis has grown significantly during the past two decades. Signalling occurs between the gut microbiota and the brain through the neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral pathways. A substantial body of evidence indicates that the MGBA plays a pivotal role in various neurological diseases. These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), non-Alzheimer's neurodegeneration and dementias, fronto-temporal lobe dementia (FTLD), Wilson-Konovalov disease (WD), multisystem atrophy (MSA), Huntington's chorea (HC), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), depression, and schizophrenia (SCZ). Furthermore, the bidirectional correlation between therapeutics and the gut-brain axis will be discussed. Conversely, the mood of delivery, exercise, psychotropic agents, stress, and neurologic drugs can influence the MGBA. By understanding the MGBA, it may be possible to facilitate research into microbial-based interventions and therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases.

## 290. Gut-Brain Axis and Neuroinflammation: The Role of Gut Permeability and the Kynurenine Pathway in Neurological Disorders.

The increasing prevalence of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis presents a significant global health challenge. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying these conditions remain elusive, with current treatments primarily addressing symptoms rather than root causes. Emerging evidence suggests that gut permeability and the kynurenine pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of these neurological conditions, offering promising targets for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies. Gut permeability refers to the intestinal lining's ability to selectively allow essential nutrients into the bloodstream while blocking harmful substances. Various factors, including poor diet, stress, infections, and genetic predispositions, can compromise gut integrity, leading to increased permeability. This condition facilitates the translocation of toxins and bacteria into systemic circulation, triggering widespread inflammation that impacts neurological health via the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network between the gut and the central nervous system. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota, can increase gut permeability and systemic inflammation, exacerbating neuroinflammation-a key factor in neurological disorders. The kynurenine pathway, the primary route for tryptophan metabolism, is significantly implicated in this process. Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in the context of inflammation leads to the production of neurotoxic metabolites, such as quinolinic acid, which contribute to neuronal damage and the progression of neurological disorders. This narrative review highlights the potential and progress in understanding these mechanisms. Interventions targeting the kynurenine pathway and maintaining a balanced gut microbiota through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle modifications show promise in reducing neuroinflammation and supporting brain health. In addition, pharmacological approaches aimed at modulating the kynurenine pathway directly, such as inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, offer potential avenues for new treatments. Understanding and targeting these interconnected pathways are crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and manage neurological disorders.

## 291. Microbial Trojan Horses: Virulence Factors as Key Players in Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Changes in population demographics indicate that the elderly population will reach 2.1 billion worldwide by 2050. In parallel, there will be an increase in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This review explores dysbiosis occurring in these pathologies and how virulence factors contribute to the worsening or development of clinical conditions, and it summarizes existing and potential ways to combat microorganisms related to these diseases. Microbiota imbalances can contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases by increasing intestinal permeability, exchanging information through innervation, and even acting as a Trojan horse affecting immune cells. The microorganisms of the microbiota produce virulence factors to protect themselves from host defenses, many of which contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. These virulence factors are expressed according to the genetic composition of each microorganism, leading to a wide range of factors to be considered. Among the main virulence factors are LPS, urease, curli proteins, amyloidogenic proteins, VacA, and CagA. These factors can also be packed into bacterial outer membrane vesicles, which transport proteins, RNA, and DNA, enabling distal communication that impacts various diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

## 292. An emerging role for the gut microbiome in tauopathy.

Tauopathies constitute a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal aggregation of the protein tau, progressive neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive and motor impairment. In this review, we will highlight the latest efforts investigating the intricate interplay between the gut microbiome and tauopathies. We discuss the physiological interactions between the microbiome and the brain as well as clinical and experimental evidence that suggests that the presence of tauopathy alters the composition of gut microbiota. We explore both animal and human studies that define causative relationships between the gut microbiome and tauopathy by directly manipulating or transferring gut microbiota. This review highlights future directions into identifying and mechanistically elucidating microbial species causally linked to tauopathies, with an ultimate goal of devising therapeutic targets towards the gut microbiome to treat tauopathies.

## 293. Probiotics as Potential Treatments for Neurodegenerative Diseases: a Review of the Evidence from in vivo to Clinical Trial.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), characterized by the progressive deterioration of the structure and function of the nervous system, represent a significant global health challenge. Emerging research suggests that the gut microbiota plays a critical role in regulating neurodegeneration via modulation of the gut-brain axis. Probiotics, defined as live microorganisms that confer health benefits to the host, have garnered significant attention owing to their therapeutic potential in NDDs. This review examines the current research trends related to the microbiome-gut-brain axis across various NDDs, highlighting key findings and their implications. Additionally, the effects of specific probiotic strains, including Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, on neurodegenerative processes were assessed, focusing on their potential therapeutic benefits. Overall, this review emphasizes the potential of probiotics as promising therapeutic agents for NDDs, underscoring the importance of further investigation into this emerging field.

## 294. Advances in Autophagy-Lysosomal Pathway and Neurodegeneration via Brain-Gut Axis. Rock inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease.

Background/Objectives: The autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is crucial for neuronal health by clearing misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. While much research has focused on ALP dysfunction in the central nervous system, new evidence shows its importance in the gut, where it affects neurodegeneration via the gut-brain axis. Past reviews have mainly studied the ALP's direct neuroprotective effects or the gut microbiota's role in neurodegeneration separately. However, the two-way relationship between the ALP and the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases is not well understood. We combine the latest findings on the ALP's role in gut health, microbial imbalance, and neuroinflammation, providing a comprehensive view of their combined effects in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Methods: This narrative review synthesizes evidence from preclinical, clinical, and translational studies (2014-2025) to explore the interplay between the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. The literature was identified via PubMed and Web of Science using search terms including autophagy, lysosome, gut microbiota, neurodegeneration, and gut-brain axis, with additional manual screening of reference lists. The inclusion criteria prioritized studies elucidating molecular mechanisms (e.g., ALP-microbiota crosstalk), while excluding case reports or non-peer-reviewed sources. Results: The gut-brain axis facilitates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through neural, immune, and metabolic pathways. Autophagy dysfunction may disrupt intestinal homeostasis, promote gut microbiota dysbiosis, and trigger chronic neuroinflammation, ultimately accelerating neurodegeneration. Notably, strategies targeting the gut microbiota and restoring intestinal barrier function via the ALP have demonstrated promising potential in delaying the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Conclusions: This review establishes the ALP as a dynamic regulator of gut-brain communication, highlighting microbiota-targeted therapies as promising strategies for neurodegeneration. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease and cause of dementia. AD pathology primarily involves the formation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). While Aβ targeted treatments have shown clinical promise, other aspects of AD pathology such as microgliosis, astrocytosis, synaptic loss, and hypometabolism may be viable targets for treatment. Among notable novel therapeutic approaches, the Ras homolog (Rho)-associated kinases (ROCKs) are being investigated as targets for AD treatment, based on the observations that ROCK1/2 levels are elevated in AD, and activation or inhibition of ROCKs changes dendritic/synaptic structures, protein aggregate accumulation, inflammation, and gliosis. This review will highlight key findings on the effects of ROCK inhibition in Aβ and ptau pathologies, as well as its effects on neuroinflammation, synaptic density, and potentially metabolism and bioenergetics.

## 295. Protective effects of fecal microbiota transplantation against ischemic stroke and other neurological disorders: an update.

The bidirectional communication between the gut and brain or gut-brain axis is regulated by several gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, and lipopolysaccharides. The Gut microbiota (GM) produce neuroactives, specifically neurotransmitters that modulates local and central neuronal brain functions. An imbalance between intestinal commensals and pathobionts leads to a disruption in the gut microbiota or dysbiosis, which affects intestinal barrier integrity and gut-immune and neuroimmune systems. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for the treatment of recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection. FMT elicits its action by ameliorating inflammatory responses through the restoration of microbial composition and functionality. Thus, FMT may be a potential therapeutic option in suppressing neuroinflammation in post-stroke conditions and other neurological disorders involving the neuroimmune axis. Specifically, FMT protects against ischemic injury by decreasing IL-17, IFN-γ, Bax, and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, FMT improves cognitive function by lowering amyloid-β accumulation and upregulating synaptic marker (PSD-95, synapsin-1) expression in Alzheimer's disease. In Parkinson's disease, FMT was shown to inhibit the expression of TLR4 and NF-κB. In this review article, we have summarized the potential sources and methods of administration of FMT and its impact on neuroimmune and cognitive functions. We also provide a comprehensive update on the beneficial effects of FMT in various neurological disorders by undertaking a detailed interrogation of the preclinical and clinical published literature.

## 296. The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorders.

Previous studies have shown a bidirectional communication between human gut microbiota and the brain, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The MGBA influences the host's nervous system development, emotional regulation, and cognitive function through neurotransmitters, immune modulation, and metabolic pathways. Factors like diet, lifestyle, genetics, and environment shape the gut microbiota composition together. Most research have explored how gut microbiota regulates host physiology and its potential in preventing and treating neurological disorders. However, the individual heterogeneity of gut microbiota, strains playing a dominant role in neurological diseases, and the interactions of these microbial metabolites with the central/peripheral nervous systems still need exploration. This review summarizes the potential role of gut microbiota in driving neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), and mood disorders (anxiety and depression) in recent years and discusses the current clinical and preclinical gut microbe-based interventions, including dietary intervention, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. It also puts forward the current insufficient research on gut microbiota in neurological disorders and provides a framework for further research on neurological disorders.

## 297. Microbiota gut-brain axis: implications for pediatric-onset leukodystrophies.

Neurodegenerative disorders are a group of diseases characterized by progressive degeneration of the nervous system, leading to a gradual loss of previously acquired motor, sensory and/or cognitive functions. Leukodystrophies are amongst the most frequent childhood-onset neurodegenerative diseases and primarily affect the white matter of the brain, often resulting in neuro-motor disability. Notably, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and complications, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and dysphagia, significantly impact patients' quality of life, highlighting the need for comprehensive management strategies. Gut dysbiosis, characterized by microbial imbalance, has been implicated in various GI disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. This narrative review explores the intricate relationship between GI symptoms, Gut Microbiota (GM), and neurodegeneration. Emerging evidence underscores the profound influence of GM on neurological functions via the microbiota gut-brain axis. Animal models have demonstrated alterations in GM composition associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Our single-centre experience reveals a high prevalence of GI symptoms in leukodystrophy population, emphasizing the importance of gastroenterological assessment and nutritional intervention in affected children. The bidirectional relationship between GI disorders and neurodegeneration suggests a potential role of gut dysbiosis in disease progression. Prospective studies investigating the GM in leukodystrophies are essential to understand the role of gut-brain axis dysfunction in disease progression and identify novel therapeutic targets. In conclusion, elucidating the interplay between GI disorders, GM, and neurodegeneration holds promise for precision treatments aimed at improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

## 298. Associations of Microbiota and Nutrition with Cognitive Impairment in Diseases.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Recent research highlights the growing interest in the impact of nutrition on cognitive health and function in disease, as dietary habits are increasingly recognized as crucial factors in relation to brain function. This focus is especially important given the rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases and the cognitive decline associated with poor dietary choices. Links are now being sought between brain function and the microbiota and gut-brain axis. Mechanisms are proposed that include low-grade chronic neuroinflammation, the influence of short-chain fatty acids, or the disruption of glial cells and transmitters in the brain. METHODS: We reviewed the articles on pubmed. This is not a systematic review, but of the narrative type. We wanted to outline the issue and summarise the latest information. RESULTS: The axis in question has its foundation in nutrition. It has been reported that diet, particularly the components and the timing of food intake, has an impact on cognitive processes. The Mediterranean diet is most often cited in the literature as being beneficial to health. In order to obtain a more complete view, it is worth considering other dietary patterns, even those that impair our health. CONCLUSIONS: Determining what is beneficial and what is not will allow us to develop a speronized strategy for the prevention of, and fight against, cognitive impairment. Appropriately selected supplements, the functions of which we have also discussed, may prove supportive.

## 299. Caloric restriction mimetics improve gut microbiota: a promising neurotherapeutics approach for managing age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

The gut microbiota (GM) produces various molecules that regulate the physiological functionality of the brain through the gut-brain axis (GBA). Studies suggest that alteration in GBA may lead to the onset and progression of various neurological dysfunctions. Moreover, aging is one of the prominent causes that contribute to the alteration of GBA. With age, GM undergoes a shift in population size and species of microflora leading to changes in their secreted metabolites. These changes also hamper communications among the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal), ENS (enteric nervous system), and ANS (autonomic nervous system). A therapeutic intervention that has recently gained attention in improving health and maintaining communication between the gut and the brain is calorie restriction (CR), which also plays a critical role in autophagy and neurogenesis processes. However, its strict regime and lifelong commitment pose challenges. The need is to produce similar beneficial effects of CR without having its rigorous compliance. This led to an exploration of calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs) which could mimic CR's functions without limiting diet, providing long-term health benefits. CRMs ensure the efficient functioning of the GBA through gut bacteria and their metabolites i.e., short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and neurotransmitters. This is particularly beneficial for elderly individuals, as the GM deteriorates with age and the body's ability to digest the toxic accumulates declines. In this review, we have explored the beneficial effect of CRMs in extending lifespan by enhancing the beneficial bacteria and their effects on metabolite production, physiological conditions, and neurological dysfunctions including neurodegenerative disorders.

## 300. Redox Homeostasis, Gut Microbiota, and Epigenetics in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review.

Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a spectrum of disorders marked by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system. These conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple sclerosis (MS), often lead to severe cognitive and motor deficits. A critical component of neurodegenerative disease pathologies is the imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms, culminating in oxidative stress. The brain's high oxygen consumption and lipid-rich environment make it particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. Pro-oxidants such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated during normal metabolism, counteracted by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses. In neurodegenerative diseases, this balance is disrupted, leading to neuronal damage. This systematic review explores the roles of oxidative stress, gut microbiota, and epigenetic modifications in neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to elucidate the interplay between these factors and identify potential therapeutic strategies. We conducted a comprehensive search of articles published in 2024 across major databases, focusing on studies examining the relationships between redox homeostasis, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes in neurodegeneration. A total of 161 studies were included, comprising clinical trials, observational studies, and experimental research. Our findings reveal that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with gut microbiota composition and epigenetic modifications significantly influencing redox balance. Specific bacterial taxa and epigenetic markers were identified as potential modulators of oxidative stress, suggesting novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, recent evidence from human and animal studies supports the emerging concept of targeting redox homeostasis through microbiota and epigenetic therapies. Future research should focus on validating these targets in clinical settings and exploring the potential for personalized medicine strategies based on individual microbiota and epigenetic profiles.

## 301. Neuroimaging techniques, gene therapy, and gut microbiota: frontier advances and integrated applications in Alzheimer's Disease research.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline, for which effective treatments remain elusive due to complex pathogenesis. Recent advances in neuroimaging, gene therapy, and gut microbiota research offer new insights and potential intervention strategies. Neuroimaging enables early detection and staging of AD through visualization of biomarkers, aiding diagnosis and tracking of disease progression. Gene therapy presents a promising approach for modifying AD-related genetic expressions, targeting amyloid and tau pathology, and potentially repairing neuronal damage. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota influences AD pathology through the gut-brain axis, impacting inflammation, immune response, and amyloid metabolism. However, each of these technologies faces significant challenges, including concerns about safety, efficacy, and ethical considerations. This article reviews the applications, advantages, and limitations of neuroimaging, gene therapy, and gut microbiota research in AD, with a particular focus on their combined potential for early diagnosis, mechanistic insights, and therapeutic interventions. We propose an integrated approach that leverages these tools to provide a multi-dimensional framework for advancing AD diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

## 302. The Importance of Gut Microbiota on Choline Metabolism in Neurodegenerative Diseases.

The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that influences digestion, immune response, metabolism, and has been linked to health and well-being. Choline is essential for neurotransmitters, lipid transport, cell-membrane signaling, methyl-group metabolism and is believed to have neuroprotective properties. It is found in two forms, water-soluble and lipid-soluble, and its metabolism is different. Long-term choline deficiency is associated with many diseases, and supplements are prescribed for improved health. Choline supplements can improve cognitive function in adults but not significantly. Choline is a precursor of phospholipids and an acetylcholine neurotransmitter precursor and can be generated de novo from phosphatidylcholine via phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase and choline oxidase. Choline supplementation has been found to have a beneficial effect on patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), by increasing amyloid-β, thioflavin S, and tau hyper-phosphorylation. Choline supplementation has been shown to reduce amyloid-plaque load and develop spatial memory in an APP/PS1 mice model of AD. Choline is necessary for normative and improved function of brain pathways and can reduce amyloid-β deposition and microgliosis. Clinical research suggests that early neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) can benefit from a combination of choline supplements and the drugs currently used to treat NDs in order to improve memory performance and synaptic functioning.

## 303. Gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease: potential links and the role of fecal microbiota transplantation.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and seriously affects the quality of life of elderly patients. PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra as well as abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein in neurons. Recent research has deepened our understanding of the gut microbiota, revealing that it participates in the pathological process of PD through the gut-brain axis, suggesting that the gut may be the source of PD. Therefore, studying the relationship between gut microbiota and PD is crucial for improving our understanding of the disease's prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In this review, we first describe the bidirectional regulation of the gut-brain axis by the gut microbiota and the mechanisms underlying the involvement of gut microbiota and their metabolites in PD. We then summarize the different species of gut microbiota found in patients with PD and their correlations with clinical symptoms. Finally, we review the most comprehensive animal and human studies on treating PD through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), discussing the challenges and considerations associated with this treatment approach.

## 304. Underneath the Gut-Brain Axis in IBD-Evidence of the Non-Obvious.

The gut-brain axis (GBA) plays a pivotal role in human health and wellness by orchestrating complex bidirectional regulation and influencing numerous critical processes within the body. Over the past decade, research has increasingly focused on the GBA in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Beyond its well-documented effects on the GBA-enteric nervous system and vagus nerve dysregulation, and gut microbiota misbalance-IBD also leads to impairments in the metabolic and cellular functions: metabolic dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cationic transport, and cytoskeleton dysregulation. These systemic effects are currently underexplored in relation to the GBA; however, they are crucial for the nervous system cells' functioning. This review summarizes the studies on the particular mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cationic transport, and cytoskeleton impairments in IBD. Understanding the involvement of these processes in the GBA may help find new therapeutic targets and develop systemic approaches to improve the quality of life in IBD patients.

## 305. Microbiota-gut-brain axis: interplay between microbiota, barrier function and lymphatic system.

The human gastrointestinal tract, boasting the most diverse microbial community, harbors approximately 100 trillion microorganisms comprising viruses, bacteria, fungi, and archaea. The profound genetic and metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiome underlie its involvement in nearly every facet of human biology, from health maintenance and development to aging and disease. Recent recognition of microbiota - gut - brain axis, referring to the bidirectional communication network between gut microbes and their host, has led to a surge in interdisciplinary research. This review begins with an overview of the current understandings regarding the influence of gut microbes on intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity. Subsequently, we discuss the mechanisms of the microbiota - gut - brain axis, examining the role of gut microbiota-related neural transmission, metabolites, gut hormones and immunity. We propose the concept of microbiota-mediated multi-barrier modulation in the potential treatment in gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Furthermore, the role of lymphatic network in the development and maintenance of barrier function is discussed, providing insights into lesser-known conduits of communication between the microbial ecosystem within the gut and the brain. In the final section, we conclude by describing the ongoing frontiers in understanding of the microbiota - gut - brain axis's impact on human health and disease.

## 306. Alzheimer's disease and gut-brain axis: Drosophila melanogaster as a model.

Research indicates that by 2050, more than 150 million people will be living with Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition associated with neurodegeneration due to the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau proteins. In addition to genetic background, endocrine disruption, and cellular senescence, management of the gut microbiota has emerged as a key element in the diagnosis, progression, and treatment of AD, as certain bacterial metabolites can travel through the bloodstream and cross the blood-brain barrier. This mini-review explores the relationship between tau protein accumulation and gut dysbiosis in Drosophila melanogaster. This model facilitates the investigation of how gut-derived metabolites contribute to neurocognitive impairment and dementia. Understanding the role of direct and indirect bacterial by-products, such as lactate and acetate, in glial cell activation and tau protein dynamics may provide insights into the mechanisms of AD progression and contribute to more effective treatments. Here we discuss how the simplicity and extensive genetic tools of Drosophila make it a valuable model for studying these interactions and testing potential therapeutics, including probiotics. Integrating Drosophila studies with other established models may reveal conserved pathways and accelerate the translation of findings into clinical applications.

## 307. Gut neuropeptide involvement in Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 10 million people. A key pathological feature of PD is the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein (aSyn) protein in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Aggregation of aSyn can form Lewy bodies that contribute to dopaminergic neuron degeneration and motor symptoms, such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Beyond the central nervous system, aSyn aggregates have been detected in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, suggesting a link between peripheral aSyn and nonmotor PD symptoms. GI symptoms, often preceding motor symptoms by up to 20 years, highlight the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system (gut-brain axis) in PD. Although microbiome alterations and intestinal inflammation have been associated with PD, functional impacts on gut-brain signaling or aSyn aggregation remain unclear. Intestinal neuropeptides are key modulators of gut-brain communication, alter immune response to pathogens and environmental toxins, and may contribute to the function of the luminal gut barrier. Dysregulation of gut neuropeptide signaling, including vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide, ghrelin, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and substance P, have been associated with pathologic effects of PD in animal models. Despite their potential role in pathogenesis and disease modulation, gut neuropeptide roles in PD are underexplored. This article reviews current knowledge surrounding microbial metabolite and immune influences on gut neuropeptide signaling, aSyn aggregation in the enteric nervous system, and downstream neuroimmune pathway alterations within the context of PD and its mouse models.

## 308. Periodontal bacteria influence systemic diseases through the gut microbiota.

Many systemic diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease, are associated with microbiota dysbiosis. The oral and intestinal microbiota are directly connected anatomically, and communicate with each other through the oral-gut microbiome axis to establish and maintain host microbial homeostasis. In addition to directly, periodontal bacteria may also be indirectly involved in the regulation of systemic health and disease through the disturbed gut. This paper provides evidence for the role of periodontal bacteria in systemic diseases via the oral-gut axis and the far-reaching implications of maintaining periodontal health in reducing the risk of many intestinal and parenteral diseases. This may provide insight into the underlying pathogenesis of many systemic diseases and the search for new preventive and therapeutic strategies.

## 309. Decoding Neurodegeneration: A Review of Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Advances in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and Huntington's, remain formidable challenges in medicine, with their relentless progression and limited therapeutic options. These diseases arise from a web of molecular disturbances-misfolded proteins, chronic neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic mutations-that slowly dismantle neuronal integrity. Yet, recent scientific breakthroughs are opening new paths to intervene in these once-intractable conditions. This review synthesizes the latest insights into the underlying molecular dynamics of neurodegeneration, revealing how intertwined pathways drive the course of these diseases. With an eye on the most promising advances, we explore innovative therapies emerging from cutting-edge research: nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems capable of navigating the blood-brain barrier, gene-editing tools like CRISPR designed to correct harmful genetic variants, and stem cell strategies that not only replace lost neurons but foster neuroprotective environments. Pharmacogenomics is reshaping treatment personalization, enabling tailored therapies that align with individual genetic profiles, while molecular diagnostics and biomarkers are ushering in an era of early, precise disease detection. Furthermore, novel perspectives on the gut-brain axis are sparking interest as mounting evidence suggests that microbiome modulation may play a role in reducing neuroinflammatory responses linked to neurodegenerative progression. Taken together, these advances signal a shift toward a comprehensive, personalized approach that could transform neurodegenerative care. By integrating molecular insights and innovative therapeutic techniques, this review offers a forward-looking perspective on a future where treatments aim not just to manage symptoms but to fundamentally alter disease progression, presenting renewed hope for improved patient outcomes.

## 310. Promotion of Healthy Aging Through the Nexus of Gut Microbiota and Dietary Phytochemicals.

Aging is associated with the decline of tissue and cellular functions, which can promote the development of age-related diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and disorders of the musculoskeletal and immune systems. Healthspan is the length of time an individual is in good health and free from chronic diseases and disabilities associated with aging. Two modifiable factors that can influence healthspan, promote healthy aging, and prevent the development of age-related diseases, are diet and microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract (gut microbiota). This review will discuss how dietary phytochemicals and gut microbiota can work in concert to promote a healthy gut and healthy aging. First, an overview is provided of how the gut microbiota influences healthy aging through its impact on gut barrier integrity, immune function, mitochondria function, and oxidative stress. Next, the mechanisms by which phytochemicals effect gut health, inflammation, and nurture a diverse and healthy microbial composition are discussed. Lastly, we discuss how the gut microbiota can directly influence health by producing bioactive metabolites from phytochemicals in food like urolithin A, equol, hesperetin, and sulforaphane. These and other phytochemical-derived microbial metabolites that may promote healthspan are discussed. Importantly, an individual's capacity to produce health-promoting microbial metabolites from cruciferous vegetables, berries, nuts, citrus, and soy products will be dependent on the specific bacteria present in the individual's gut.

## 311. An Anti-Inflammatory Diet and Its Potential Benefit for Individuals with Mental Disorders and Neurodegenerative Diseases-A Narrative Review.

This narrative review synthesizes current evidence regarding anti-inflammatory dietary patterns and their potential benefits for individuals with mental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Chronic low-grade inflammation is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the etiology and progression of these conditions. The review examines the evidence for the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of dietary components and food groups, focusing on whole foods rather than specific nutrients or supplements. Key dietary components showing potential benefits include fruits and vegetables (especially berries and leafy greens), whole grains, legumes, fatty fish rich in omega-3, nuts (particularly walnuts), olive oil, and fermented foods. These foods are generally rich in antioxidants, dietary fiber, and bioactive compounds that may help modulate inflammation, support gut health, and promote neuroprotection. Conversely, ultra-processed foods, red meat, and sugary beverages may be harmful. Based on this evidence, we designed the Brain Anti-Inflammatory Nutrition (BrAIN) diet. The mechanisms of this diet include the modulation of the gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis, the regulation of inflammatory pathways, a reduction in oxidative stress, and the promotion of neuroplasticity. The BrAIN diet shows promise as an aid to manage mental and neurodegenerative disorders.

## 312. Associations Between Gut Microbiota Composition and Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease.

Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are a debilitating non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD), often associated with dopaminergic therapy. However, their occurrence in some patients but not others suggests additional biological mechanisms, including the gut microbiome. In this study, we analyzed 191 PD patients (14 with ICDs, 177 without) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the association between gut microbiota and ICDs. No significant differences were observed in alpha or beta diversity between groups, but several bacterial taxa showed differential abundances. Notably, Methanobrevibacter and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens were enriched in ICD patients. Functional pathway analysis revealed differences in metabolic pathways, including enrichment of xenobiotic degradation and nicotinate metabolism in the ICD group. These findings suggest that specific gut microbial taxa and their associated metabolic functions may contribute to ICDs in PD, highlighting a potential non-dopaminergic mechanism and opening new avenues for microbiome-targeted intervention.

## 313. The gut microbiota and aging: interactions, implications, and interventions.

The human microbiota, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms inhabiting various body sites, particularly the gut, plays a crucial role in maintaining health and influencing disease susceptibility. Dysbiosis, characterized by alterations in microbial composition and diversity, has been implicated in numerous diseases, including those associated with aging. This review examines the complex relationship between gut microbiota and aging, highlighting the age-associated gut microbiota alterations, the factors contributing to these changes, the links between microbiota and age-related diseases, and the potential of interventions targeting the microbiome to extend lifespan and improve health outcomes in the elderly. Further research is needed to unravel the intricate mechanisms underlying the interplay between the microbiome and aging, paving the way for innovative strategies to promote healthy aging.

## 314. Biofilm-Associated Amyloid Proteins Linked with the Progression of Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Biofilm-associated amyloid proteins have emerged as significant contributors to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, representing a complex intersection of microorganisms and human health. The cross-beta sheet structure characteristic of amyloids produced by gut-colonizing bacteria remains intact, crucial for the resilience of biofilms. These amyloids exacerbate neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by cross-seeding human amyloidogenic proteins like amyloid-beta and α-synuclein, accelerating their misfolding and aggregation. Despite molecular chaperones and heat shock proteins maintaining protein homeostasis, bacterial amyloids can overwhelm them, worsening neuronal damage. Genetic variations in chaperone genes further influence amyloidogenesis and neurodegeneration. Persistent bacterial infections and inflammation compromise the blood-brain barrier, allowing inflammatory molecules and amyloids to enter the brain, perpetuating the cycle of neurodegeneration. The gut-brain axis underscores the impact of dysbiosis and gut microbiota on brain function, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. The enhancement of biofilm resilience and antibiotic resistance by functional amyloid fibrils complicates the treatment landscape. The interplay among chaperone systems, microbial amyloids, and neurodegenerative diseases underscores the urgent need for advanced treatment strategies targeting these pathways to attenuate disease progression. Understanding the processes that relate biofilm-associated amyloids to the onset of neurological disorders is critical for diagnosing and developing novel treatment strategies.

## 315. Exploring the interaction between the gut microbiota and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A signaling pathway: a potential therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases.

The interaction between the gut microbiota and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway in the host's central nervous system plays a crucial role in neurological diseases and enhances communication along the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota influences the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway through its metabolites, which activates the vagus nerve and modulates the immune and neuroendocrine systems. Conversely, alterations in the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway can affect the composition of the gut microbiota, creating a dynamic network of microbial-host interactions. This reciprocal regulation affects neurodevelopment, neurotransmitter control, and behavioral traits, thus playing a role in the modulation of neurological diseases. The coordinated activity of the gut microbiota and the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway regulates processes such as amyloid-β protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal energy metabolism, microglial activation, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter release, which collectively influence the onset and progression of neurological diseases. This study explores the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, along with its implications for potential therapeutic interventions in neurological diseases. Recent pharmacological research has shown that restoring the balance between gut flora and cAMP-PKA signaling pathway may improve outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases and emotional disorders. This can be achieved through various methods such as dietary modifications, probiotic supplements, Chinese herbal extracts, combinations of Chinese herbs, and innovative dosage forms. These findings suggest that regulating the gut microbiota and cAMP-PKA signaling pathway may provide valuable evidence for developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.

## 316. The Determination of Trimethylamine N-Oxide and Organic Acids Connected with Gut Microbiota in the Urine of Parkinson's Disease Patients: A Pilot Study.

Parkinson's disease (PD) progression appears closely tied to gut microbiota alterations, with microbial metabolites potentially influencing neurodegeneration. This pilot study employed GC-MS and LC-MS/MS to analyze the urinary levels of gut-derived metabolites-including succinic acid, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid (HVA), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), adipic acid, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)-in 20 PD patients versus 20 age-matched controls. The key findings revealed that PD patients exhibited significantly elevated succinic acid (p = 0.0018) and HVA (p = 0.0002) levels alongside reduced TMAO (p = 1.65 × 10(-5)). Notably, succinic acid showed an inverse correlation with disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr scale: r = -0.63; p = 0.0028), while TMAO demonstrated a strong positive association (r = 0.81; p = 0.00001). The elevated HVA, a dopamine metabolite, may serve as a potential biomarker for monitoring levodopa treatment efficacy. These results suggest that gut microbiota metabolites contribute to PD pathogenesis, with TMAO and succinic acid emerging as promising biomarkers for tracking disease progression. This study highlights the clinical potential of non-invasive urinary metabolite profiling using GC-MS and LC-MS/MS techniques. However, further investigation through larger-scale studies is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms connecting gut microbiota dysbiosis to PD neurodegeneration.

## 317. The Potential of Metabolomics to Find Proper Biomarkers for Addressing the Neuroprotective Efficacy of Drugs Aimed at Delaying Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease Progression.

The first objective is to highlight the lack of tools to measure whether a given intervention affords neuroprotection in patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases. A second aim is to present the primary outcome measures used in clinical trials in cohorts of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The final aim is to discuss whether metabolomics using body fluids may lead to the discovery of biomarkers of neuroprotection. Information on the primary outcome measures in clinical trials related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease registered since 2018 was collected. We analysed the type of measures selected to assess efficacy, not in terms of neuroprotection since, as stated in the aims, there is not yet any marker of neuroprotection. Proteomic approaches using plasma or CSF have been proposed. PET could estimate the extent of lesions, but disease progression does not necessarily correlate with a change in tracer uptake. We propose some alternatives based on considering the metabolome. A new opportunity opens with metabolomics because there have been impressive technological advances that allow the detection, among others, of metabolites related to mitochondrial function and mitochondrial structure in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid; some of the differentially concentrated metabolites can become reliable biomarkers of neuroprotection.

## 318. Targeting natural antioxidant polyphenols to protect neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases: a comprehensive review.

Polyphenols, naturally occurring phytonutrients found in plant-based foods, have attracted significant attention for their potential therapeutic effects in neurological diseases and neuroinflammation. These compounds possess diverse neuroprotective capabilities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-amyloid properties, which contribute to mitigating the progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Dementia, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Stroke, and Huntington's Disease (HD). Polyphenols have been extensively studied for their ability to regulate inflammatory responses by modulating the activity of pro-inflammatory genes and influencing signal transduction pathways, thereby reducing neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Additionally, polyphenols have shown promise in modulating various cellular signaling pathways associated with neuronal viability, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. Epidemiological and clinical studies highlight the potential of polyphenol-rich diets to decrease the risk and alleviate symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, polyphenols have demonstrated their therapeutic potential through the regulation of key signaling pathways such as Akt, Nrf2, STAT, and MAPK, which play critical roles in neuroprotection and the body's immune response. This review emphasizes the growing body of evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of polyphenols in combating neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, as well as enhancing brain health. Despite the substantial evidence and promising hypotheses, further research and clinical investigations are necessary to fully understand the role of polyphenols and establish them as advanced therapeutic targets for age-related neurodegenerative diseases and neuroinflammatory conditions.

## 319. Comparative analysis of neuroinflammatory pathways in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis: insights into similarities and distinctions.

Neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to the significant socioeconomic burden due to aging society, are gaining increasing interest. Despite each disease having different etiologies, neuroinflammation is believed to play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition to the pathogenic function of inflammation in the brain there is growing evidence that immune responses are essential for neuroregeneration. This review compares and contrasts the neuroinflammatory pathways that selected neurodegenerative diseases share and have in common. In AD, tau tangles and beta-amyloid plaques cause microglia and astrocytes to become activated in an inflammatory response. Alpha-synuclein aggregation stimulate neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease, especially in the substantia nigra. In Multiple Sclerosis an autoimmune attack on myelin is connected to inflammation via invading immune cells. Commonalities include the release of pro-inflammatory mediators like cytokines and activation of signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK. Comprehending these common routes is essential for discovering early diagnostic possibilities for the diseases and possible tailored treatments. Our work underscores the potential for insights into disease mechanisms. Identifying common targets offers promise for advancing our understanding and potential future treatment approaches across these debilitating disorders.

## 320. Secondary Bioactive Metabolites from Foods of Plant Origin as Theravention Agents against Neurodegenerative Disorders.

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) are on the rise, robbing people of their memories and independence. While risk factors such as age and genetics play an important role, exciting studies suggest that a diet rich in foods from plant origin may offer a line of defense. These kinds of foods, namely fruits and vegetables, are packed with a plethora of powerful bioactive secondary metabolites (SBMs), including terpenoids, polyphenols, glucosinolates, phytosterols and capsaicinoids, which exhibit a wide range of biological activities including antioxidant, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, anti-Alzheimer's, antiproliferative, and antimicrobial properties, associated with preventive effects in the development of chronic diseases mediated by oxidative stress such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, respiratory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and NDDs. This review explores the potential of SBMs as theravention agents (metabolites with therapeutic and preventive action) against NDDs. By understanding the science behind plant-based prevention, we may be able to develop new strategies to promote brain health and prevent the rise in NDDs. The proposed review stands out by emphasizing the integration of multiple SBMs in plant-based foods and their potential in preventing NDDs. Previous research has often focused on individual compounds or specific foods, but this review aims to present a comprehensive fingerprint of how a diet rich in various SBMs can synergistically contribute to brain health. The risk factors related to NDD development and the diagnostic process, in addition to some examples of food-related products and medicinal plants that significantly reduce the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), are highlighted.

## 321. Oral Microbiome: A Review of Its Impact on Oral and Systemic Health. Biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease: From Basic Research to Clinical Practice.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review investigates the oral microbiome's composition, functions, influencing factors, connections to oral and systemic diseases, and personalized oral care strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: The oral microbiome is a complex ecosystem consisting of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses that contribute to oral health. Various factors, such as diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions, can affect the balance of the oral microbiome and lead to dysbiosis, which can result in oral health issues like dental caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, oral candidiasis, and halitosis. Importantly, our review explores novel associations between the oral microbiome and systemic diseases including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrinal, and neurological conditions, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. We comprehensively review the efficacy of interventions like dental probiotics, xylitol, oral rinses, fluoride, essential oils, oil pulling, and peptides in promoting oral health by modulating the oral microbiome. SUMMARY: This review emphasizes the critical functions of the oral microbiota in dental and overall health, providing insights into the effects of microbial imbalances on various diseases. It underlines the significant connection between the oral microbiota and general health. Furthermore, it explores the advantages of probiotics and other dental care ingredients in promoting oral health and addressing common oral issues, offering a comprehensive strategy for personalized oral care. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized pathologically by dopaminergic neuron loss and the formation of Lewy bodies, which are enriched with aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn). PD currently has no cure, but therapeutic strategies are available to alleviate symptoms. Early diagnosis can greatly improve therapeutic interventions, but the clinical diagnosis of PD remains challenging and depends mainly on clinical features and imaging tests. Efficient and specific biomarkers are crucial for the diagnosis, monitoring, and evaluation of PD. Here, we reviewed the biomarkers of PD in different tissues and biofluids, along with the current clinical biochemical detection methods. We found that the sensitivity and specificity of single biomarkers are limited, and selecting appropriate indicators for combined detection can improve the diagnostic accuracy of PD.

## 322. Exploring the ketogenic diet's potential in reducing neuroinflammation and modulating immune responses.

The ketogenic diet (KD) is marked by a substantial decrease in carbohydrate intake and an elevated consumption of fats and proteins, leading to a metabolic state referred to as "ketosis," where fats become the primary source of energy. Recent research has underscored the potential advantages of the KD in mitigating the risk of various illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and cancer. The macronutrient distribution in the KD typically entails high lipid intake, moderate protein consumption, and low carbohydrate intake. Restricting carbohydrates to below 50 g/day induces a catabolic state, prompting metabolic alterations such as gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. Ketogenesis diminishes fat and glucose accumulation as energy reserves, stimulating the production of fatty acids. Neurodegenerative diseases, encompassing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease are hallmarked by persistent neuroinflammation. Evolving evidence indicates that immune activation and neuroinflammation play a significant role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The protective effects of the KD are linked to the generation of ketone bodies (KB), which play a pivotal role in this dietary protocol. Considering these findings, this narrative review seeks to delve into the potential effects of the KD in neuroinflammation by modulating the immune response. Grasping the immunomodulatory effects of the KD on the central nervous system could offer valuable insights into innovative therapeutic approaches for these incapacitating conditions.

## 323. Epigenetic Mechanisms in Aging: Extrinsic Factors and Gut Microbiome.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Aging is a natural physiological process involving biological and genetic pathways. Growing evidence suggests that alterations in the epigenome during aging result in transcriptional changes, which play a significant role in the onset of age-related diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. For this reason, the epigenetic alterations in aging and age-related diseases have been reviewed, and the major extrinsic factors influencing these epigenetic alterations have been identified. In addition, the role of the gut microbiome and its metabolites as epigenetic modifiers has been addressed. RESULTS: Long-term exposure to extrinsic factors such as air pollution, diet, drug use, environmental chemicals, microbial infections, physical activity, radiation, and stress provoke epigenetic changes in the host through several endocrine and immune pathways, potentially accelerating the aging process. Diverse studies have reported that the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating brain cell functions through DNA methylation and histone modifications. The interaction between genes and the gut microbiome serves as a source of adaptive variation, contributing to phenotypic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways driving this process are still not fully understood. CONCLUSIONS: Extrinsic factors are potential inducers of epigenetic alterations, which may have important implications for longevity. The gut microbiome serves as an epigenetic effector influencing host gene expression through histone and DNA modifications, while bidirectional interactions with the host and the underexplored roles of microbial metabolites and non-bacterial microorganisms such as fungi and viruses highlight the need for further research.

## 324. Neuroinflammaging: A Tight Line Between Normal Aging and Age-Related Neurodegenerative Disorders.

Aging in the healthy brain is characterized by a low-grade, chronic, and sterile inflammatory process known as neuroinflammaging. This condition, mainly consisting in an up-regulation of the inflammatory response at the brain level, contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Development of this proinflammatory state involves the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, able to induce age-related epigenetic modifications. Indeed, the exposure to environmental compounds, drugs, and infections, can contribute to epigenetic modifications of DNA methylome, histone fold proteins, and nucleosome positioning, leading to epigenetic modulation of neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, some epigenetic modifiers, which combine and interact during the life course, can contribute to modeling of epigenome dynamics to sustain, or dampen the neuroinflammatory phenotype. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about neuroinflammaging with a particular focus on epigenetic mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of neuroinflammatory cascades in the central nervous system; furthermore, we describe some diagnostic biomarkers that may contribute to increase diagnostic accuracy and help tailor therapeutic strategies in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

## 325. Metabolomics in Parkinson's Disease and Correlation with Disease State.

Changes in the level of metabolites, small molecules that are intermediates produced by metabolism or catabolism, are associated with developing diseases. Metabolite signatures in body fluids such as plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva are associated with Parkinson's disease. Here, we discuss alteration of metabolites in the TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, kynurenic network, and redox system. We also summarize the efforts of many research groups to differentiate between metabolite profiles that characterize PD motor progression and dyskinesia, gait and balance, and non-motor symptoms such as depression and cognitive decline. Understanding how changes in metabolites lead to progression in PD may allow for the identification of individuals at the earliest stage of the disease and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

## 326. Maternal exposure to pesticides induces perturbations in the gut microbiota and blood-brain barrier of dams and the progeny, prevented by a prebiotic.

Exposure to pesticide residues during the first 1000 days of life can disrupt body homeostasis and contribute to chronic metabolic diseases. Perinatal chlorpyrifos (CPF) exposure alters gut microbiota (GM) balance, potentially affecting offspring's health. Given the GM influence on brain function, the primary aim is to determine if pesticide-induced dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) affects indirectly other organs, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The secondary objective is to evaluate the prebiotics protective effects, particularly inulin in promoting microbial balance (symbiosis), in both mothers and offspring. A total of 15 or more female rats were divided in 4 groups: control, oral CPF-exposed (1 mg/kg/day), exposed to inulin (10 g/L), and co-exposed to CPF and inulin from pre-gestation until weaning of pups. Samples from intestines, spleen, liver, and brain microvessels underwent microbiological and biomolecular analyses. Bacterial culture assessed GM composition of living bacteria and their translocation to non-intestinal organs. RT qPCR and Western blotting detected gene expression and protein levels of tight junction markers in brain microvessels. CPF exposure caused gut dysbiosis in offspring, with decreased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and increased Escherichia coli (p < 0.01) leading to bacterial translocation to the spleen and liver. CPF also decreased tight junction's gene expression levels (50 to 60% decrease of CLDN3, p < 0.05). In contrast, inulin partially mitigated these adverse effects and restored gene expression to control levels. Our findings demonstrate a causal link between GM alterations and BBB integrity disruptions. The protective effects of inulin suggest potential therapeutic strategies to counteract pesticide-induced dysbiosis.

## 327. Inflammaging and Brain Aging.

Progress made by the medical community in increasing lifespans comes with the costs of increasing the incidence and prevalence of age-related diseases, neurodegenerative ones included. Aging is associated with a series of morphological changes at the tissue and cellular levels in the brain, as well as impairments in signaling pathways and gene transcription, which lead to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. Although we are not able to pinpoint the exact differences between healthy aging and neurodegeneration, research increasingly highlights the involvement of neuroinflammation and chronic systemic inflammation (inflammaging) in the development of age-associated impairments via a series of pathogenic cascades, triggered by dysfunctions of the circadian clock, gut dysbiosis, immunosenescence, or impaired cholinergic signaling. In addition, gender differences in the susceptibility and course of neurodegeneration that appear to be mediated by glial cells emphasize the need for future research in this area and an individualized therapeutic approach. Although rejuvenation research is still in its very early infancy, accumulated knowledge on the various signaling pathways involved in promoting cellular senescence opens the perspective of interfering with these pathways and preventing or delaying senescence.

## 328. From Fundamentals to Innovation in Alzheimer's Disease: Molecular Findings and Revolutionary Therapies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health concern and the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. The prevalence of this neurodegenerative condition is projected to increase concomitantly with increased life expectancy, resulting in a significant economic burden. With very few FDA-approved disease-modifying drugs available for AD, there is an urgent need to develop new compounds capable of impeding the progression of the disease. Given the unclear etiopathogenesis of AD, this review emphasizes the underlying mechanisms of this condition. It explores not only well-studied aspects, such as the accumulation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, but also novel areas, including glymphatic and lymphatic pathways, microbiota and the gut-brain axis, serotoninergic and autophagy alterations, vascular dysfunction, the metal hypothesis, the olfactory pathway, and oral health. Furthermore, the potential molecular targets arising from all these mechanisms have been reviewed, along with novel promising approaches such as nanoparticle-based therapy, neural stem cell transplantation, vaccines, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing techniques. Taking into account the overlap of these various mechanisms, individual and combination therapies emerge as the future direction in the AD strategy.

## 329. Bifidobacterium infantis and Bifidobacterium breve Improve Symptomatology and Neuronal Damage in Neurodegenerative Disease: A Systematic Review.

Background/Objectives: This systematic review focused on collecting the most significant findings on the impact of the administration of Bifidobacterium infantis (or Bifidobacterium longum subps. infantis) and Bifidobacterium breve, alone, in conjunction, or in combination with other strains, in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These diseases are characterized by the progressive degeneration of neurons, resulting in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. AD is typified by a progressive decline in cognitive abilities, while PD is marked by motor symptoms associated with the loss of dopamine (DA). Methods: Five different databases, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS), were reviewed and the studies were screened for inclusion by the following criteria: (i) studies that specifically evaluated the use of Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, or Bifidobacterium breve as a therapeutic intervention, either in human or animal models, in the context of neurodegenerative diseases; (ii) the studies were required to address one or more of the pathologies examined in this article, and the pathologies included, but were not limited to, neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and oxidative stress; (iii) the full text was accessible online; and (iv) the article was written in English. Results: The data suggest that these probiotics have neuroprotective effects that may delay disease progression. Conclusions: This study provides updated insights into the use of these Bifidobacterium strains in neurodegenerative diseases like AD and PD, with the main limitation being the limited number of clinical trials available.

## 330. Novel strategies in Parkinson's disease treatment: a review.

An unprecedented extension of life expectancy observed during the past century drastically increased the number of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's diseases (PD) worldwide. Estimated costs of PD alone reached $52 billion per year, making effective neuroprotective treatments an urgent and unmet need. Current treatments of both AD and PD focus on mitigating the symptoms associated with these pathologies and are not neuroprotective. In this review, we discuss the most advanced therapeutic strategies that can be used to treat PD. We also critically review the shift of the therapeutic paradigm from a small molecule-based inhibition of protein aggregation to the utilization of natural degradation pathways and immune cells that are capable of degrading toxic amyloid deposits in the brain of PD patients.

## 331. Intestinal Microbiota in Early Life: Latest Findings Regarding the Role of Probiotics as a Treatment Approach for Dysbiosis.

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in early-life development, influencing various aspects of health and disease. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota, has been linked to multiple health conditions, including allergies, asthma, and obesity. In early life, the gut microbiota plays a key role in the development and maturation of the immune system. Probiotics, live microorganisms that confer health benefits when administered in adequate amounts, have emerged as a potential treatment approach for dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis can alter the resistance to pathogens, promoting atopic diseases, food sensitization, and infections such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Probiotics have been shown to modulate the composition and function of the gut microbiota in the perinatal and infant periods. They can increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, and reduce the levels of potentially harmful bacteria. Not all probiotics are created equal. The effects of probiotics can vary depending on the specific strain used. Probiotics have also been investigated for their potential benefits in other areas of infant health, such as reducing the risk of respiratory infections and improving growth and development. This review aims to analyze the current data in the literature and to evaluate the health benefits of probiotic administration in early life. Several studies have investigated the use of probiotics in preventing or treating allergic diseases, such as eczema and food allergies. While some studies have shown promising results, more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of probiotics in early life. In conclusion, using probiotics to prevent dysbiosis-related conditions may be considered a method of ‘programming’ the individual for optimal health maintenance.

## 332. Systemic determinants of brain health in ageing.

Preservation of brain health is a worldwide priority. The traditional view is that the major threats to the ageing brain lie within the brain itself. Consequently, therapeutic approaches have focused on protecting the brain from these presumably intrinsic pathogenic processes. However, an increasing body of evidence has unveiled a previously under-recognized contribution of peripheral organs to brain dysfunction and damage. Thus, in addition to the well-known impact of diseases of the heart and endocrine glands on the brain, accumulating data suggest that dysfunction of other organs, such as gut, liver, kidney and lung, substantially affects the development and clinical manifestation of age-related brain pathologies. In this Review, a framework is provided to indicate how organ dysfunction can alter brain homeostasis and promote neurodegeneration, with a focus on dementia. We delineate the associations of subclinical dysfunction in specific organs with dementia risk and provide suggestions for public health promotion and clinical management.
