A: SCFAs, by acting through specific receptors and signaling pathways, are implicated in both the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
B: The concentration levels of SCFAs in AD patient or animal models are summarized to illustrate their exclusive role in dietary fiber fermentation, rather than in neurodegenerative disease mechanisms.
C: The translational value of SCFAs in Alzheimer's disease is limited to their effects on host metabolism, without relevance to cognitive or pathological features.
D: Although SCFAs participate in immune regulation and appetite control, their summarized effects in Alzheimer's disease models include modulation of cognitive level, Aβ and tau pathology, and neuroinflammation.

Options:
A: The postbiotic-induced increase in SCFAs would directly restore hippocampal 5-HT levels before reducing neuroinflammation, as SCFAs bypass the need for gut microbiota normalization.
B: SCFA-mediated modulation of gut microbiota would first attenuate gut and systemic inflammation, which in turn could reduce hippocampal IL-6 and IL-1β expression, thereby ameliorating neuroinflammation.
C: Introduction of postbiotics after neurotransmitter imbalance would have no effect on neuroinflammation, since the kynurenine pathway activation is irreversible once initiated by malathion.
D: The postbiotic intervention would initially enhance autophagic flux in microglia, leading to reduced amyloid-β plaques, but only after normalization of tryptophan metabolism and attenuation of gut barrier impairment.

Q6: In a scenario where 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is genetically ablated in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model that is first maintained under germ-free (GF) conditions and then, after a delay, colonized with a microbiota rich in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, which of the following predictions about amyloid plaque deposition and microglial phenotype is most consistent with the regulatory hierarchy and temporal sequence described in the context?
Options:
A: Amyloid plaque deposition will remain low despite SCFA supplementation, because 5-LO ablation prevents both neuroinflammation and the SCFA-induced upregulation of microglial ApoE.
B: Delayed colonization with SCFA-producing bacteria will increase Aβ plaque load to levels comparable to specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice, as SCFA act downstream of 5-LO in promoting amyloid deposition.
C: Microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques will be increased after SCFA supplementation, but microglia will contain more intracellular Aβ due to the absence of 5-LO.
D: The absence of 5-LO will block the effect of gut-derived pro-inflammatory mediators, but SCFA-induced changes in microglial transcriptomics, including ApoE upregulation, may still promote Aβ deposition.

Options:
A: The improvement in cognitive abilities after KXSJW treatment is solely attributable to central nervous system effects, independent of any alterations in gut microbiota or their metabolites.
B: KXSJW-induced modulation of gut microbiota composition directly increases serum glucagon and GHRP-Ghrelin levels, which then triggers restoration of the intestinal barrier before any changes in cognitive function are observed.
C: Restoration of Firmicutes abundance and butyric acid levels by KXSJW precedes improvement in intestinal barrier integrity, which subsequently leads to reduced neuroinflammation and enhanced cognitive performance.
D: Immediate reduction of β-amyloid deposition in brain tissue occurs prior to any detectable changes in gut microbial metabolite concentrations following KXSJW administration.

Options:
A: Amyloid-beta accumulation will remain unaltered because ILA requires the presence of tryptophan to activate the AhR pathway in microglia.
B: Delayed ILA administration can still reduce amyloid-beta levels via AhR activation in microglia, even after microbiota depletion, as ILA acts independently of gut-derived metabolites.
C: Neuroinflammation will be attenuated only if gut microbiota are restored prior to ILA administration, since ILA’s effect is contingent on microbiota-driven tryptophan metabolism.
D: The reduction in soluble amyloid-beta levels depends on ILA-mediated AhR activation in microglia, which can occur even after microbiota depletion if ILA is administered, but the absence of tryptophan co-administration may limit the full preventative effect observed in combined treatments.

Options:
A: Immediate reduction of peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines, without prior changes in gut microbiota, would directly result in sex-independent decreases in Aβ amyloidosis.
B: A reduction in plaque-associated reactive microglia and an increase in homeostatic microglia would still occur in male mice, even if gut microbiota composition remains unchanged after GV-971 treatment.
C: The absence of gut microbiota modulation would prevent GV-971 from elevating amino acid production and influencing the tryptophan pathway, thereby disrupting the downstream reduction in neuroinflammatory signatures.

C: EPS directly suppresses neuroinflammatory responses by inhibiting serotonin production, while simultaneously reducing Erysipelotrichaceae abundance in the gut.
D: While EPS modulates the gut microbiome, its anti-AD efficacy is primarily attributed to the suppression of the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway, which in turn inhibits microglial phagocytosis of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>.

Q18: When considering the foundational concept of how microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFA) influence Alzheimer’s disease pathology, which of the following statements accurately reflect mechanistic outcomes observed under altered SCFA exposure or microbiome status?
Options:

C: Complete reversal of synaptic deficits is expected, as autophagy enhancement fully compensates for ongoing bEV-mediated microglial activation.
D: Amyloid-β plaque burden may initially decrease due to enhanced autophagy, but persistent microglial activation driven by residual bEVs could sustain neuroinflammation.

Q41: In a scenario where middle-aged APP/PS1 mice are subjected to voluntary wheel running after a period of established gut dysbiosis and elevated TMAO levels, which of the following predictions about the regulatory cascade from gut microbiota to cognitive outcome are most consistent with the described mechanisms and temporal sequence in the context?
Options:
A: Elevated TMAO levels, if unaddressed prior to exercise, can continue to promote neuroinflammation and amyloid aggregation, thereby limiting the cognitive benefits of exercise in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice despite changes in hippocampal protein expression.
B: Initiating voluntary exercise in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice will directly increase short-chain fatty acid production, leading to immediate neuroprotection and reversal of cognitive decline, regardless of prior gut dysbiosis.
C: Exercise in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice will primarily reduce ADAM10 and GFAP expression in the hippocampus, but will not significantly alter circulating metabolites or reverse cognitive impairment, due to the lack of improvement in gut microbiota-derived metabolite profiles.
D: The reduction in Proteobacteria and Tenericutes abundance following exercise in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice is sufficient to restore synaptic plasticity proteins and fully normalize cognitive function, independent of changes in circulating metabolites.

Options:
A: Cognitive improvement may be limited, as both TRF-induced B. pseudolongum and NMN-driven SCFA increases are implicated in mitigating neuroinflammation.
B: Neuroinflammation may persist, since neither propionic acid nor butyrate-mediated anti-inflammatory effects are fully engaged.
C: Amyloid-beta aggregation is likely to be reduced solely by NMN, regardless of gut microbiota changes, due to its direct effect on synaptic dysfunction.

Options:
A: Neuroinflammation is likely to be suppressed, as gut dysbiosis consistently reduces the production of all microbial metabolites implicated in Alzheimer's disease progression.
B: The vulnerability to cognitive decline may persist or worsen, since higher circulating TMAO—if produced despite dysbiosis—can promote oxidative stress and reduce synaptic plasticity.
C: Cognitive function may initially improve due to positive effects of TMAO precursors on blood-brain barrier integrity, unless the altered gut microbiota composition prevents effective conversion to TMAO.
D: Manipulation of the gut microbiota through dietary intervention may delay Alzheimer's disease progression, but only if the supplementation of TMAO precursors is withheld to avoid exacerbating neuroinflammation.

Q45: In a scenario where male APPPS1-21 mice are first raised under germ-free conditions to minimize gut microbiota influence, and then, after Aβ burden becomes detectable, are treated with GV-971 while simultaneously being exposed to commensal gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles (bEVs), which of the following predictions about microglial activation and amyloid pathology can be made by integrating regulatory effects across the microbiota-microglia-amyloid axis and considering the temporal order of interventions?
Options:
A: The introduction of bEVs after germ-free rearing will reverse the reduced microglial activation and Aβ plaque accumulation, counteracting the initial protective effect of microbiota depletion.
B: GV-971 treatment will reduce cerebral amyloidosis and dampen microglial activation in male mice, but this effect will be negated if bEVs are introduced after Aβ burden is already maximal.
C: The sequential exposure to germ-free conditions, followed by bEVs and GV-971, will result in a persistent reduction of pro-inflammatory microglial phenotypes, regardless of the timing of bEV administration.
D: If bEVs are introduced after GV-971 treatment has begun, the pro-inflammatory shift in microglial activation and Aβ pathology induced by bEVs may partially override the anti-inflammatory and amyloid-lowering effects of GV-971 in male mice.

Options:
A: CBD administration would promote a shift of hippocampal microglia from M1 to M2 phenotype, but the initial dysbiosis-induced barrier compromise would allow persistent leakage of intestinal toxic metabolites, partially sustaining neuroinflammation.
B: Immediate restoration of gut barrier integrity by CBD would precede any changes in microglial activation, fully preventing neuroinflammation regardless of prior dysbiosis.
C: The delayed CBD intervention would reduce hippocampal and colon epithelial cell LPS levels, but the initial dysbiosis would have already irreversibly impaired cognitive function, making microglial phenotype shifts ineffective.
D: CBD would elevate Bacteroidetes and reduce Firmicutes, thereby strengthening the intestinal barrier, but without any effect on microglial activation due to the prior dysbiosis.

Q48: Considering the foundational mechanisms described for neurodegenerative disease (ND) insurgence and progression, which of the following statements accurately reflect the regulatory logic of the diet-microbiota-gut-brain (DMGB) axis and its components, except when the temporal sequence of neuroinflammation is reversed?
Options:
A: While alteration of the microbiota can influence neuronal inflammatory status, this effect is only observed when mitochondrial and peroxisomal metabolism in the intestinal epithelium remains unaltered.

Options:
A: Initial B. pseudolongum supplementation increases propionic acid, improving cognitive function and reducing Aβ deposition, but subsequent antibiotic treatment reverses these benefits by eliminating all propionic acid production.
B: B. pseudolongum persists after antibiotic treatment, maintaining elevated propionic acid levels, which continue to support improved cognitive function and reduced Aβ deposition despite overall microbiota depletion.
C: The antibiotic-induced depletion of most gut bacteria except B. pseudolongum leads to increased microglial activation and exacerbated Aβ deposition due to loss of butyrate-producing commensals, even though propionic acid remains elevated.
D: Cognitive function initially improves due to B. pseudolongum-driven propionic acid production, but after antibiotics, the loss of other beneficial bacteria disrupts the gut-brain axis, partially diminishing but not abolishing the cognitive benefits, as B. pseudolongum and its metabolite persist.

Options:
A: Delayed SCFA supplementation in GF AD mice will promote a microglial phenotype that is associated with reduced intracellular Aβ content despite increased recruitment to plaques.
B: SCFA supplementation will increase Aβ plaque load in GF AD mice to levels comparable to conventionally colonized animals, accompanied by upregulation of microglial ApoE expression.
C: The initial absence of gut microbiota in GF AD mice will result in increased microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques, which is then reversed by delayed SCFA supplementation.

Options:
A: ATEP increases antioxidant enzyme activities, which subsequently alters the nuclear Nrf2 content and modulates downstream oxidation-related enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO-1.
B: Remodeling of gut microbiota by ATEP directly suppresses the Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway, thereby increasing iNOS and COX-2 expression in the hippocampus.
C: ATEP’s neuroprotective effects are mediated solely by its impact on short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, independent of hippocampal protein expression changes.

B: Gut microbiota dysbiosis resulting in altered metabolite production that modulates microglial activity, thereby mediating neuroinflammation and promoting neuronal necrosis.
C: Intestinal microbiota metabolites directly reducing microglial activity, which in turn prevents neuroinflammation and slows neuronal necrosis in Alzheimer’s disease.
D: Amyloid-beta deposition in the brain causing subsequent dysbiosis of oral and gut microbiota, which then accelerates neurodegenerative changes.

Q59: If a therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD) simultaneously delays the increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria while only partially suppressing neuroinflammatory responses, which of the following outcomes may most plausibly result, given the described mechanisms and regulatory order in the context?
Options:
A: The formation of serotonin-associated behavioral improvements may appear to occur independently of gut microbiota modulation, unless overridden by persistent dysbiosis.
B: Restoration of brain redox balance is expected to precede improvements in spatial memory, provided that Erysipelotrichaceae reduction is achieved before Ruminococcaceae enrichment.
C: Cognitive impairment may persist despite partial neuroinflammation suppression, as the absence of timely SCFAs-producer enrichment limits gut-brain axis-mediated amelioration.
D: Amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance is likely to be fully restored, since microglial activation via the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway does not require changes in gut microbiota composition.

Options:
A: The negative correlation between FW values in the hippocampus and the relative abundance of butyrate producers is most pronounced in the AD/MCI group, while the NC group shows a positive correlation.

Options:
A: Initiating synbiotic therapy after the exercise period will have no effect on gut barrier integrity, as exercise in middle-aged mice already reduced ADAM10 and GFAP expression in the hippocampus.
B: Because voluntary exercise in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice reduced the abundance of Proteobacteria and Tenericutes, subsequent synbiotic supplementation will further decrease these phyla, directly resulting in reduced tau phosphorylation.
C: The combination of late synbiotic administration and prior exercise will elevate indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) levels and increase the abundance of IPA-synthesizing bacteria, which may correlate with improved cognitive performance.
D: The delayed synbiotic intervention is likely to restore synaptic ultrastructure and suppress neuroinflammatory responses, even though exercise alone did not improve cognitive function in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice.

B: The reduction of Aquabacterium, Corynebacterium, and Romboutsia by synbiotic therapy directly results from decreased IPA synthesis in the gut microbiota.
C: Restoration of synaptic ultrastructure and suppression of neuroinflammation in 5xFAD mice are observed following synbiotic treatment, although these effects occur independently of changes in amyloid-β accumulation.
D: Enhanced prevalence of IPA-synthesizing bacteria, such as Lachnospira and Clostridium, is associated with synbiotic-induced improvements in spatial memory and gut barrier integrity.

Q64: In a scenario where 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activity is genetically ablated in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model, and this is followed by delayed administration of an exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Agaricus sinodeliciosus var. Chaidam, which is known to modulate gut microbiota and enhance microglial Aβ-phagocytosis via the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway, which of the following outcomes would most likely be observed at both the neuroinflammatory and gut metabolite regulatory levels, considering the temporally sequenced effects of 5-LO ablation and subsequent EPS intervention?
Options:
A: The absence of 5-LO would directly prevent EPS-induced increases in serotonin production by the gut microbiota, thereby nullifying EPS's behavioral benefits.
B: EPS administration after 5-LO ablation would still promote microglial Aβ clearance through the mTOR-HIF-1α pathway, while the lack of 5-LO would independently reduce neuroinflammation, resulting in additive neuroprotective effects.
C: Delayed EPS intervention would reverse the initial reduction in neuroinflammation caused by 5-LO ablation by restoring Erysipelotrichaceae abundance, thereby exacerbating AD pathology.
D: The sequential intervention would first reduce neuroinflammation via 5-LO ablation, and then EPS would further modulate the gut microbiota, increasing Ruminococcaceae and serotonin, which together contribute to improved cognitive function and redox balance.

Options:
A: Neuroinflammation may persist despite some improvement in learning and memory, as the absence of increased SCFAs limits full restoration of gut-brain axis signaling.
B: Cognitive function is likely to normalize rapidly, since partial microbiota correction alone is sufficient to reverse all AD-related brain changes.

Options:
A: Malathion-induced reduction of Lactobacillus and Akkermansia precedes increased indole derivatives and KYN pathway activation, but delayed PCA administration can still restore glucose metabolism via PI3K/AKT/Glut1 signaling, partially ameliorating neuroinflammation.
B: Immediate PCA administration would prevent malathion-induced gut barrier impairment, but delayed intervention cannot modulate hippocampal IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA upregulation once neuroinflammation is established.
C: The increase in neurotoxic KYN metabolites caused by malathion exposure directly upregulates PI3K/AKT/Glut1 signaling, thereby enhancing cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice.
D: Delayed PCA administration in the context of prior malathion-induced gut dysbiosis will first normalize hippocampal neurotransmitter levels, which subsequently leads to restoration of gut microbiota composition.

Q69: When considering foundational mechanisms by which gut-residing bacteria and their metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of common brain diseases, which of the following statements accurately reflect context-dependent regulatory or pathway distinctions described in the text?

C: The gut microbiota regulates immune responses through metabolite production and immune cell interactions, although this does not impact neuroinflammatory processes in Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.
D: Therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota are explored to alleviate neuroinflammatory processes, while disruptions in microbial communities are not linked to neurodegenerative disease pathology.

Q71: In the context of APP/PS1 mice, which of the following mechanistic outcomes would most likely occur if gut microbiota-derived Indoles are increased during a period of tryptophan deficiency, considering the regulatory pathways described?
Options:
A: Upregulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) production would occur, while NF-κB pathway activation and NLRP3 inflammasome formation would be inhibited, leading to reduced inflammatory cytokine release.
B: Tryptophan deficiency would enhance the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, even if Indoles are present at elevated levels.
C: Increased Indoles would directly stimulate the release of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18, although AhR production remains unchanged.
D: Indoles-producing bacteria would prevent Aβ accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation, except when the NF-κB pathway is simultaneously activated by external stimuli.

B: The Mediterranean diet, by enhancing gut-brain communication and decreasing neuroinflammation, is linked to reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease progression.
C: Although increased blood-brain barrier permeability is a consequence of neuroinflammation, it directly causes gut dysbiosis by altering CNS signaling to the gastrointestinal tract.
D: While gut dysbiosis is associated with increased neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition, restoration of microbial balance through probiotics may reduce systemic inflammation and neurodegenerative risk.

Q73: If a scenario arises in which mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) administration is delayed until after significant gut barrier integrity damage and LPS leak have already occurred in 5xFAD AD mice, but short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are supplemented concurrently, which of the following outcomes may be expected, considering the interplay between gut microbiota composition, microbial metabolites, and neuroinflammation?
Options:
A: SCFAs supplementation may still attenuate behavioral disorders and Aβ accumulation, even if MOS fails to prevent initial gut barrier damage and LPS leak.
B: The absence of early MOS-induced reshaping of the gut microbiota may limit the increase in Lactobacillus abundance, potentially reducing the neuroprotective effects otherwise observed.
C: Delayed MOS administration, if not accompanied by SCFAs supplementation, would likely enhance Helicobacter abundance and exacerbate HPA-axis disorders.
D: Early restoration of gut barrier integrity by MOS is required for SCFAs to balance HPA-axis hormones and redox status in the brain.

Q74: If a therapeutic intervention in a neurodegenerative mouse model only partially restores the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio but fully prevents the shift of hippocampal microglia to the M1 phenotype, while the intestinal barrier remains morphologically compromised, which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the described mechanisms in the context?
Options:
A: Persistent elevation of hippocampal and colon epithelial cell LPS may continue to promote neuroinflammation and neuronal death, despite microglial phenotype normalization.
B: Cognitive function may appear improved due to microglial M2 predominance, unless overridden by ongoing intestinal barrier leakage of toxic metabolites.
C: The absence of a fully restored intestinal barrier may limit the neuroprotective effects of microglial phenotype shift, as gut-derived LPS can still access the CNS.

Q75: In a scenario where aged APP/PS1 mice are first subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) that alters gut microbiota and increases peripheral cholesterol, and are subsequently treated with Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD), which of the following predictions about hippocampal neuroinflammation and cognitive function can be made by integrating multi-omics findings and regulatory feedback between gut-derived metabolites, bile acid signaling, and glial activation?
Options:
A: HFD-induced changes in gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism may create a microenvironment that improves LXR/PPAR expression, and subsequent HLJDD treatment further relieves neuroinflammation, supporting a hierarchical gut-brain regulatory effect.
B: The increase in peripheral cholesterol from HFD directly elevates hippocampal Aβ levels, which is then reversed by HLJDD through modulation of the RAGE-JAK2-STAT3 pathway.
C: HLJDD’s anti-inflammatory effects are only observed if HFD first causes a significant deterioration in contextual memory, as shown by multi-omics analysis of aged hippocampus.

Q76: If a female Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model is subjected to both partial suppression of gut microbiota-derived metabolites and incomplete activation of the GPER/CREB/BDNF pathway, which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the described mechanisms, assuming no compensatory increase in host-derived soluble factors?
Options:
A: Neuroinflammation may persist due to insufficient modulation of immune function by the gut-brain axis, despite the presence of plant estrogen SDG.
B: Cognitive impairment is likely to be fully reversed, as alterations in microbial composition are overridden by partial GPER/CREB/BDNF pathway activation.
C: The decline in beneficial bacteria may initially lead to exacerbation of neurodegeneration, unless overridden by robust production of microbial metabolites.
D: The anti-inflammatory effects of SDG may appear diminished, as incomplete pathway activation fails to compensate for reduced microbiota-derived metabolite signaling.

Q77: If a scenario arises in which Hericium coralloides polysaccharide (HCP) administration is delayed until after significant amyloid-β plaque deposition has occurred, and simultaneously, indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) is provided but with only partial aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation due to competitive inhibition, which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the described mechanisms, assuming no compensatory increase in bile acid (BA) signaling across the microbiota-gut-brain axis?
Options:
A: Cognitive impairment is likely to be fully reversed, since delayed HCP administration can substitute for incomplete ILA-AhR signaling by upregulating BA-mediated neuroendocrine function.
B: The reduction in neuroinflammation may be attenuated, as HCP’s enhancement of autophagic flux is less effective after established plaque deposition, and ILA’s partial AhR activation limits microglial and astrocytic response.
C: Amyloid-β plaque burden may persist, because neither delayed HCP nor partially suppressed ILA-AhR signaling can sufficiently activate the endogenous receptors targeted by BAs in the absence of increased BA signaling.
D: The polarization of M2 microglia will be enhanced, unless overridden by the lack of BA biotransformation by gut microbes, which may initially lead to increased Tau protein accumulation.

Q78: When considering foundational concepts underlying the combined use of environmental enrichment and <i>Bifidobacterium breve</i> CCFM1025 in Alzheimer's disease mice, which statements accurately reflect mechanistic outcomes that distinguish this multidomain intervention from single-factor approaches?
Options:
A: The combination of EE and <i>B. breve</i> CCFM1025 reverses AD-associated changes in microbial metabolites, whereas EE alone only restores gut microbiota composition without affecting metabolites.
B: While most prior interventions targeted a single AD-related factor with modest cognitive effects, the integrated approach alleviates Aβ-induced cognitive impairment and inhibits neuroinflammation.
C: The observed cognitive improvements are attributed solely to the restoration of tryptophan metabolism, although acetate levels remain unchanged by the intervention.
D: The multidomain strategy delays AD progression by corroborating microbiota-metabolite-brain interactions, with acetate and tryptophan metabolism identified as potential mechanistic drivers.

Options:
A: Butyrate reverses QA-induced cognitive impairment primarily by reducing QA synthesis in the cortex, although this does not affect BDNF levels.
B: Butyrate counteracts QA-induced neuronal spine loss and BDNF reduction, in part through epigenetic enhancement of H3K18ac at BDNF promoters.
C: QA-induced dopaminergic and glutamatergic neuron lesions in Caenorhabditis elegans are prevented by butyrate, while cortical gray matter loss remains unaffected.
D: The negative relationship between serum QA and cognitive function in human obesity is mitigated by butyrate through direct inhibition of neuroinflammatory cytokine production, except when BDNF signaling is intact.

Options:
A: The combined approach would first suppress HPA-axis disorders via MOS, followed by exercise-induced reduction in Allobaculum, ultimately leading to improved cognitive function and reduced amyloid-β accumulation.
B: The interventions would primarily act by directly increasing brain norepinephrine levels, independent of changes in gut barrier integrity or microbial metabolites, thus bypassing effects on neuroinflammation.
C: The sequential interventions would synergistically reduce LPS displacement and neuroinflammation by first increasing butyrate formation and then further enriching Akkermansia, thereby strengthening the intestine-brain barrier and attenuating amyloid-β pathology.
D: The delayed treadmill exercise would negate the initial benefits of MOS on gut microbiota composition, resulting in increased Helicobacter abundance and exacerbated neuroinflammation despite improved butyrate levels.

Options:
A: Activation of MAPK signaling by PCA directly promotes nuclear translocation of NF-κB, thereby enhancing neuroinflammation in Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-injected mice.
B: PCA ameliorates Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>-induced disruption of glucose metabolism primarily through activation of PI3K/AKT/Glut1 signaling, while also modulating neuroinflammation via inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation.
C: Restoration of gut microbiota homeostasis by PCA is a downstream effect of improved cognitive function, rather than a contributing mechanism to its anti-AD action.
D: PCA reduces the abundance of pro-inflammatory-associated gut microbiota, which is closely linked to changes in serum metabolites involved in glucose and phospholipid metabolism.

Q82: Considering the foundational concepts described, which statements best reflect the mechanistic roles of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease via inflammatory pathways, particularly when regulatory direction or context is altered?
Options:
A: While gut microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can mediate inflammation, their effect on AD progression is only indirect through systemic, not neuroinflammatory, pathways.
B: The metabolites of gut bacteria, such as short-chain fatty acids and branched amino acids, can directly or indirectly regulate Alzheimer's disease by modulating inflammatory responses.
C: Amyloid peptides produced by gut microbiota contribute to the regulation of inflammation, thereby influencing the development of Alzheimer's disease.
D: Although bile acids are functional by-products of gut microbiota, they exclusively affect AD pathology through non-inflammatory mechanisms.

Options:
A: Remodeling of the gut microbiota may appear to promote neuroprotection, but incomplete restoration of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria could restrict the full benefit of ATEP supplementation.
B: Microglial activation in the brain would be completely suppressed, since partial restoration of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria is sufficient to fully inhibit the Akt/NF-κB pathway.
C: The neuronal morphology in the CA3 region of the hippocampus would remain unaffected, unless the Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway is fully activated and all critical protein expressions are normalized.
D: The anti-inflammatory effects in the hippocampus may be limited, as changes in Nrf2 nuclear content and downstream oxidation-related enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO-1 would not be fully realized.

Q84: In a scenario where aged APP/PS1 mice are first subjected to a high-fat diet to induce gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation, and only after the onset of significant memory impairment are they treated with a combination of quinic acid and Agathobacter rectalis supplementation, which of the following predictions about the multi-level regulatory effects on neuroinflammation and cognitive function is most consistent with the described mechanisms and temporal sequence in the context?
Options:
A: The delayed introduction of quinic acid and A. rectalis will synergistically restore gut microbial tryptophan and butyrate metabolite levels, leading to suppression of both DR3/IKK/NF-κB and Akt/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby reducing microglial activation and improving cognitive outcomes.
B: Early high-fat diet-induced reduction in short-chain fatty acids will irreversibly impair the ability of subsequent A. rectalis supplementation to modulate the Akt/NF-κB pathway, resulting in persistent neuroinflammation despite later intervention.
C: The combination therapy will primarily act by increasing Gram-negative bacteria abundance, thereby enhancing LPS-mediated immune activation and worsening neuroinflammation in the brain.
D: Although quinic acid can increase tryptophan metabolites and suppress DR3/IKK/NF-κB signaling, the absence of initial environmental enrichment will prevent any improvement in gut microbiota composition or cognitive function.

Q85: In a scenario where antibiotic-mediated gut microbiota perturbation is initiated after the onset of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, and subsequently, a marine-derived oligosaccharide (GV-971) is administered in a sex-specific manner, which of the following predictions about the regulatory cascade from microbiota alteration to neuroinflammatory and transcriptomic outcomes in Alzheimer's disease models is most consistent with the described findings?
Options:
A: GV-971 treatment following antibiotic-induced microbiota perturbation will universally reduce cerebral amyloidosis and reactive microglia in both male and female mice, independent of strain or treatment timing.
B: The elevation of amino acid production and modulation of the tryptophan pathway by GV-971 are associated with reduced peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles and sex-specific transcriptomic changes in the cerebral cortex.
C: Initiating GV-971 after Aβ burden is near maximal levels leads to a reduction in plaque-associated reactive microglia and an increase in homeostatic microglia, but only in male mice.
D: The neuroprotective effects of GV-971 are mediated solely by direct inhibition of beta-amyloid peptide accumulation, without involvement of gut microbiota or immune modulation.

Q86: In a scenario where 5xFAD mice are first subjected to gut barrier integrity disruption leading to increased LPS leakage, and only after a delay are treated with mannan oligosaccharide (MOS), which of the following predictions about the sequence of gut-brain axis and neuroinflammatory responses is most consistent with the described regulatory hierarchy and timing in the context?
Options:
A: Immediate restoration of brain redox status will precede any observable changes in gut microbiota composition following delayed MOS intervention.
B: The reduction in Aβ accumulation in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala will occur only after MOS-induced enhancement of butyrate formation and related microbial levels.
C: Early normalization of corticosterone (CORT) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels will require prior prevention of LPS leak by MOS, which is not possible if MOS is administered after barrier disruption.
D: Behavioral improvements and attenuation of anxiety-like behaviors will be directly attributable to the initial LPS leak, independent of subsequent MOS-induced microbiome reshaping.

Q87: If a synbiotic intervention with Clostridium sporogenes and xylan is administered to AD model mice, but the upregulation of IPA-synthesizing bacteria is only partial and the reduction of dominant AD-associated bacteria is delayed, which of the following outcomes may most accurately reflect the interplay of gut-brain axis mechanisms described in the context?
Options:
A: Cognitive and intellectual deficits may appear only modestly improved, as partial IPA elevation correlates with incomplete restoration of synaptic ultrastructure and persistent neuroinflammatory responses.
B: Amyloid-β accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus is likely to increase, unless the abundance of S24-7 family bacteria is simultaneously upregulated by BEP2.
C: The gut barrier integrity may initially remain disrupted, unless the intervention also includes physical activity to reduce neuroinflammation-related signaling pathways.
D: The prevalence of Aquabacterium, Corynebacterium, and Romboutsia may remain elevated, thereby limiting the full behavioral benefits typically associated with synbiotic supplementation.

Q88: In a scenario where mice with d-galactose and aluminum chloride-induced Alzheimer's disease are first subjected to a dietary regimen that depletes short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and only after a delay are administered Armillariella tabescens-derived polysaccharides (ATEP), which of the following predictions about hippocampal neuroinflammation and downstream molecular signaling is most consistent with the regulatory hierarchy and timing described in the context?
Options:
A: The delayed ATEP intervention will immediately restore SCFA-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in the hippocampus, leading to rapid normalization of HO-1 and NQO-1 expression.
B: Initial depletion of SCFA-producing bacteria will exacerbate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and delayed ATEP administration may only partially recover antioxidant enzyme activities due to persistent dysbiosis.
C: Early loss of SCFA-producing bacteria will upregulate the Keap-1/Nrf2 pathway, but subsequent ATEP supplementation will invert this effect by directly increasing iNOS and COX-2 expression.
D: The sequence of SCFA depletion followed by late ATEP supplementation will result in persistent microglial activation, as ATEP cannot remodel the gut microbiota or influence downstream hippocampal protein expression once dysbiosis is established.

Options:
A: Microglial cells would revert to a more inflammatory state, while amyloid-β plaque accumulation would increase relative to germ-free conditions.
B: Synaptic deficits would be further ameliorated beyond the protection observed in germ-free AD mice.
C: The reduced amyloid-β pathology seen in germ-free AD mice would be maintained despite bEV administration.
D: The reversal of microglial activation and Aβ plaque accumulation would indicate that bEVs alone are sufficient to recapitulate the effects of a conventional microbiota.

Options:
A: Microglial cells would shift toward a less inflammatory state, further reducing amyloid-β pathology beyond germ-free conditions.
B: The protective effect against synaptic deficits observed in germ-free AD mice would be reversed following bEV administration.
C: Amyloid-β plaque accumulation would increase, coinciding with enhanced microglial activation after bEV exposure.

Options:
A: Elevated Eubacterium and Desulfovibrio will directly increase hydrogen sulfide production, immediately reversing TRF-induced improvements in cognitive function before FFAR3 knockdown exerts any effect.
B: Maintenance of DHPS at baseline will prevent any changes in hydrogen sulfide-mediated inflammation, but delayed FFAR3 knockdown will still disrupt the PA-mediated neuroprotective pathway, reducing TRF efficacy.
C: The cognitive benefits of TRF will be diminished due to impaired FFAR3 signaling, even though PA production and DHPS levels remain unaltered.
D: The restoration of gut barrier integrity by TRF will compensate for FFAR3 knockdown, fully preserving cognitive improvements regardless of PA signaling.

Options:
A: The alteration of gut microbial community composition by NMN in AD mice is a consequence of reduced neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction in the brain.
B: NMN treatment in AD mice increases the abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bacteroides, thereby contributing to improved intestinal health and amelioration of AD features.
C: Increased SCFAs-producing bacteria following NMN administration in AD mice is observed only when mitochondrial abnormalities are experimentally induced prior to treatment.
D: NMN’s effect on AD pathology is partially mediated by its capacity to regulate the gut-brain axis through changes in intestinal flora, which may influence central nervous system disorders.

Options:
A: Persistent elevation of free water in temporal and limbic gray matter regions may be observed, correlating with continued cognitive decline, as the delayed reduction in butyrate producers fails to sufficiently mitigate neuroinflammation.
B: Cognitive impairment may initially appear stable, unless overridden by a rapid increase in Agathobacter rectalis abundance, which would directly suppress neuroinflammation via the Akt/NF-κB pathway.
C: Early normalization of free water in the hippocampus is likely, since partial suppression of microglial activation by non-butyrate metabolites can fully compensate for the delayed loss of butyrate producers.
D: The negative correlation between butyrate-producing genera and free water values in gray matter regions is abolished, provided that microglial activation is only partially suppressed and other gut microbial metabolites are unchanged.

Q97: If a patient with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) undergoes a partial suppression of Firmicutes using low-dose antibiotics, but simultaneously receives chronic supplementation with <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp., which of the following outcomes may be most consistent with the mechanisms described, assuming no compensatory increase in Bacteroidetes occurs?
Options:
A: The patient may experience reduced gut barrier integrity due to insufficient restoration of anti-inflammatory crosstalk, unless <i>Lactobacillus</i> metabolites directly compensate for Firmicutes loss.
B: There may be an initial improvement in bone health, as <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. can regulate bone resorption and formation even when overall Firmicutes are suppressed.
C: Cognitive function may remain impaired unless the shift in microglial activation from M1 to M2, as seen with CBD, is also achieved by <i>Lactobacillus</i> supplementation.

A: Cognitive improvement may be limited, as the absence of increased Lactobacillus spp. could restrict anti-inflammatory signaling to distant organs, despite partial SCFA elevation.
B: Neuroinflammation may initially decrease due to exercise-induced reduction in p-GSK3β activity, even if SCFA-mediated gut-brain signaling is incomplete.
C: The lack of change in gut Lactobacillus spp. abundance would prevent any modulation of bone resorption or formation, thereby directly impairing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.
